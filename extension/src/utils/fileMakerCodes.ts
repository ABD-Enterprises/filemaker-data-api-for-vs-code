/**
 * FileMaker and Data API error codes: what they mean and what to do. One table for the whole
 * extension (the UI error messages and the AI `explain error` tool).
 *
 * `meaning` is the short, stable description. `advice` says what the user can do or what to ask
 * the FileMaker administrator, and is added to the message the user sees. `category` drives
 * behaviour: which buttons an error shows and whether anything is retried.
