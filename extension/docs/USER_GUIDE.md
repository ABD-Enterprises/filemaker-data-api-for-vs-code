# FileMaker Data API Tools: User Guide

This is the manual for operators and developers who use the extension to work with a FileMaker database from VS Code. It covers version 1.6, including what changed since 1.5 (listed under [New in 1.6](#new-in-16)) and since 1.4 ([New in 1.5](#new-in-15)). The screenshots show a mock FileMaker Data API with made-up data. You can open it from VS Code with **FileMaker: Open User Guide**.

Command names below are the titles you see in the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux). Every command starts with `FileMaker:`.

## Connection won't work? Diagnose Connection

Open the Command Palette and run **FileMaker: Diagnose Connection**. Choose the active connection, another saved profile, or **Type a server address (without saving)** for a quick check. Enter an address such as `https://fm.example.com` or `https://fm.example.com:8443`. A saved address with a path prefix, such as `https://fm.example.com/fm`, works too. Nothing is saved for a typed check.

The report opens as a new Markdown document in your editor and follows your editor theme. Each check shows **PASS**, **WARN** or **FAIL** and the time it took. It checks the address, looks up the server name, tries the port, reads the secure connection's certificate, checks VS Code's network settings, and asks the Data API for its product information. It does **not** sign in, send credentials, or change your certificate trust. Each network check has an eight-second limit. Use **Cancel** on the progress notification to stop.

Start with **Most likely cause** at the end of the report. For a certificate with no server names (including FileMaker Server's default certificate), ask your administrator to confirm the fingerprint, then run **Connect** and choose **Trust**. For an expired certificate, ask the administrator to renew it. The report shows the full SHA-256 fingerprint in uppercase pairs separated by colons, just like the Trust dialog. A server sending only its leaf certificate may use a private root authority or may be missing an intermediate; the leaf alone cannot distinguish them. If your organization runs its own authority, set its CA file (**Certificate authority file**) in the profile. For a public authority such as Let's Encrypt, ask the administrator to check and install the full server chain. The report puts missing-intermediate advice first only when a CA file is already configured, the server sends only the leaf, and verification still fails with an issuer error; a missing intermediate is then likely, though the CA file could also be wrong. If your profile uses the older **Allow self-signed** setting, it already accepts any certificate; switch to trusting the confirmed fingerprint instead. A certificate from a public authority is usually the easiest long-term solution.

Trusted-fingerprint profiles and older **Allow self-signed** profiles work with VS Code's default `http.proxySupport` setting on direct connections. The extension uses a connection path VS Code does not replace. Custom CA profiles still go through VS Code and system proxies as before. A trusted-fingerprint profile that needs a proxy is refused with `PIN_THROUGH_PROXY`: exclude the server in the proxy settings or, for an environment proxy, add it to `NO_PROXY`. An older Allow self-signed profile behind an environment proxy keeps its previous proxy route. If that route cannot apply its certificate settings, the report may suggest trying `http.proxySupport` set to `fallback`. Proxy setting and environment-variable values are hidden in the report. The DNS, port and certificate checks connect directly; the Data API check uses the extension's actual connection settings. For a proxy profile, this check diagnoses the **FileMaker Server address**, not the middleware's sign-in or certificate. It requests `/fmi/data/vLatest/productInfo` after any server path prefix; a custom API path can still need attention afterwards.

Connection diagnosis uses certificate date failures to recommend checking dates or renewing the certificate, rather than changing an already configured CA file. A Data API failure takes priority over advice to change an older certificate setting.

Diagnose Connection was checked on one real server on 2026-10-21: the server had a valid Let's Encrypt certificate and used TLS 1.2. Every step passed; no sign-in was attempted.

Choose **Copy for bug report** when the report is ready, or run **FileMaker: Copy Connection Diagnosis for Bug Report** later. Answer **Hide the server address?** before anything is copied. Hiding also removes the port and certificate details that could reveal the address. The report leaves out passwords, tokens, API keys, request headers and cookies. The copy command copies the original diagnosis, even if you have edited the open document.

Turn off offline mode before running a check. In Restricted Mode, you can check your own saved connection or type an address yourself; an address from the workspace's profile template is refused until you trust the workspace. This read-only check follows the same connection policy as Test Connection and does not need permission to edit records.

## Command reference

The table lists every extension command. Titles have the **FileMaker:** prefix in VS Code. “Shown” describes palette visibility; “needs” describes additional requirements when you run the command. A profile means a saved connection profile. Server operations also need access to the server and the relevant FileMaker privileges. Feature settings, workspace trust, offline mode and enterprise policy still apply as described in the sections below.

## First run in 10 minutes

This is the shortest path from nothing to a first query. Each step links to the detail.

1. **Install.** In VS Code open the Extensions view (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for **FileMaker Data API Tools** (publisher SureForgeTech) and select **Install**.
2. **Open a folder** (File > Open Folder...). Saved queries, schema snapshots, generated types and the offline cache are stored in the folder, so open one even if you only want to try a find. When VS Code asks whether you trust the authors of the folder, choose **Yes, I trust the authors** (see [Trusted workspace and Restricted Mode](#trusted-workspace-and-restricted-mode)).
3. **Check the server side.** You need the Data API enabled, an HTTPS address, and an account whose privilege set has the `fmrest` extended privilege ([how](#before-you-start)). If the server still uses FileMaker's default certificate, expect one extra step in the next item ([details](#first-connection-to-a-server-with-filemakers-default-certificate)).
4. **Create a profile.** Run **FileMaker: Add Connection Profile**. Choose **Direct**, enter a name, the server URL (`https://fm.example.com`), the database name (without `.fmp12`), the account and the password. Select **Test Connection**. If a dialog asks whether to trust the server's certificate, read it (see [Certificates](#certificates)) and decide. When the badge is green select **Save Profile**.
5. **Connect.** Select **Connect Now** in the notification that appears after saving (or run **FileMaker: Connect**). The sidebar fills with layouts.
6. **Run your first find.** Right-click a layout and choose **Open Query Builder**, add a condition and select **Run**.

Something failed? Start with [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting): the first rows cover certificate errors, the most common first-run problem. Test Connection tells you which step failed.

### First connection to a server with FileMaker's default certificate

A new FileMaker Server uses a built-in certificate until the administrator installs another one. Your computer does not trust it, so the first Test Connection stops at the certificate. This is expected and takes three clicks:

**Before you start:** you do not need to change a VS Code setting to trust a certificate. If your network uses a proxy, the server must be excluded from that proxy before a trusted certificate can be used.

1. Select **Test Connection** in the wizard. The extension reads the certificate before it sends anything, then shows a dialog titled **Trust this certificate for "<profile name>"?** Its first line, "Why it was refused", uses the same wording as the error message: when the certificate looks like FileMaker Server's default one it says "This server uses a certificate that is not trusted: FileMaker Server's default certificate is self-signed. You can trust this certificate, or install a certificate from a public authority on the server." Neither the dialog nor the error suggests a CA file for a certificate without host names; a CA-file sentence appears only for a certificate that does list host names.
2. Look at the certificate in the dialog. As read from one real FileMaker Server 22 (it is not known whether every installation is the same), expect a **Subject** naming `Claris Self Signed Certificate (Not for Production Use)`, an **Issuer** naming `Claris Root Authority`, **Names: (none listed)**, the validity dates and a **SHA-256** fingerprint. If the Subject and Issuer are something else, or you did not expect a certificate warning, stop and ask your administrator. If it looks right, compare the SHA-256 with the one your administrator gives you (or the certificate in the Admin Console), and select **Trust this certificate**. The test then runs again by itself.
3. When the badge is green, select **Save Profile**. The fingerprint is stored in the profile, so later connections need no click.

Why the trust dialog and not a CA file: the default certificate has no host names in it, so no certificate authority file can make it match the server's address on its own. Trusting that one certificate is the working option. The extension accepts exactly this certificate for this connection and refuses a different one later. It is not known whether FileMaker Server's default certificate is the same on every installation; if it is, pinning it only tells you when it changes, it does not tell you that you reached your server (see [What pinning does and does not give you](#what-pinning-does-and-does-not-give-you)).

**For production, do not rely on this.** The default certificate is labelled "Not for Production Use". Install a certificate from a public certificate authority, plus the intermediate certificate, in FileMaker Server's Admin Console (Configuration > SSL Certificate), then restart the server as the console says. After that every computer trusts the server with no dialog; remove the pinned certificate by editing the profile and choosing **Forget trusted certificate**.

---

## Before you start

You need:

- A **FileMaker Server** with the **FileMaker Data API** enabled. (FileMaker Cloud is untested: the extension has no Claris ID login, and whether a Cloud tenant accepts an account name and password on the Data API is not confirmed. Ask Claris or your administrator.) On Server this is in the Admin Console under Connectors.
- A server address your computer can reach over **HTTPS**, with a **certificate your computer trusts**. If your server uses FileMaker's default certificate, a company authority's certificate or a self-signed one, the connection wizard can trust it (see [Certificates](#certificates)); a certificate from a public authority needs nothing.
- A **FileMaker account** whose privilege set has the **`fmrest`** extended privilege (called "Access via FileMaker Data API"). To grant it, open the database in FileMaker Pro, choose File > Manage > Security, edit the account's privilege set, open **Extended Privileges**, and tick `fmrest`. Without it the sign-in fails and can look like a wrong password.
- **VS Code 1.96 or newer.**
- **A folder open in VS Code** for anything that is saved: saved queries, schema snapshots, type generation, the offline cache and the AI context copy.

See [Compatibility](./COMPATIBILITY.md) for server versions and caveats.

The maintenance review keeps support for VS Code 1.96 or newer. Your saved connections, certificate choices and proxy settings carry over; there are no new commands or setup steps.

Use a dedicated account for this work, with only the access you need. A FileMaker privilege set is the one limit that holds no matter what the extension, an AI tool or you do.

### Trusted workspace and Restricted Mode

VS Code has a safety feature called Workspace Trust. When you open a folder you have not trusted, VS Code runs in **Restricted Mode** (a banner says so) and extensions must limit themselves. Choose **Yes, I trust the authors** in the banner or dialog when the folder is yours or comes from a source you trust. You can review it with **Workspaces: Manage Workspace Trust**.

In Restricted Mode the connection wizard shows a notice at the top (with a **Manage Workspace Trust** button) that says what is limited: a profile template in the project is ignored, and workspace settings that change how connections and commands behave are ignored until you trust the workspace. Your own profile, password and Test Connection work as usual, and a profile you save is yours (it is not stored in the project). The notice goes away when you trust the workspace.

In an untrusted workspace this extension can browse, read metadata and run finds. It will not edit, create or delete records, upload to containers, run scripts, write generated files, run batch jobs, load plugins, start the FM Web preview, or register AI tools, and it ignores a `.filemaker/profile-template.json`. Trust is checked each time, and a panel that is already open refuses changes if trust is lost. A trusted workspace is also not a free pass: the extension still asks before risky actions. See [Security behavior you will notice](#security-behavior-you-will-notice).

### Windows, Linux and macOS

The extension runs on macOS, Windows and Linux desktops (VS Code 1.96 or newer). Things that differ:

- **Shortcuts.** `Cmd` on macOS is `Ctrl` on Windows and Linux.
- **Passwords** are kept in the operating system's keychain through VS Code: Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, a keyring (such as GNOME Keyring) on Linux. A Linux desktop without a running keyring gives "SecretStorage unavailable (…)" (see [Troubleshooting](#signing-in)).
- **AI server for MCP clients.** It listens on a local socket on macOS and Linux and on a named pipe on Windows. The client needs Node.js 18 or newer on its PATH. It does not run in remote windows (SSH, WSL, Dev Containers, Codespaces).
- **Generated files.** File names avoid names Windows reserves (such as `CON` or `NUL`), and names that differ only in letter case can share a file on Windows and on macOS's default disk format. Generated files use LF line endings on every system. A generated file that is marked read-only (for example by a version-control tool) is still updated and stays read-only. Your workspace folder itself may be a symbolic link, as is common on macOS. Links or directory junctions below it in an output path are refused, even if they point inside the workspace. The message explains which folder to fix; generating types for every layout also shows this refusal.
- **Copied commands.** **Copy as curl** produces a command for a POSIX shell (sh, bash, zsh); use the `.http`, fetch() or Postman formats in PowerShell or cmd.exe.

What has been checked: build, lint, type check and the unit tests run on Windows and Linux on every change. The real VS Code screens have been driven by the UI test suite on macOS only, and no automated test runs against a real FileMaker Server (the tests use a mock of the Data API). See [Compatibility](./COMPATIBILITY.md) for details and what is not tested.

### Opening your user settings

Several settings (everything under `filemaker.ai.*` except `hiddenFields`) are read from your **user** settings only. To edit them, run **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)** from the Command Palette and add entries such as `"filemaker.ai.enabled": true`, or run **Preferences: Open Settings (UI)**, search for `filemaker`, and make sure the **User** tab is selected (not **Workspace**).

## What's new in 1.4

New:

- **Use AI with FileMaker, safely.** Off by default. **FileMaker: Write AI Context** writes a short description of your layouts, fields and script names for AI coding tools. AI tools in VS Code (agent mode) can list layouts, read records and, only if you allow it, change one record at a time or run scripts you approve. You approve every change. See [Using AI with FileMaker](#using-ai-with-filemaker).
- **Edit-conflict protection in the Record Editor.** If someone else changes a record after you opened it, your save is refused instead of overwriting their change. The editor shows which fields changed and keeps your edits. See [Edit a record](#edit-a-record).
- **Empty results are not errors.** A find that matches nothing now returns an empty result. Before, it showed an error, and a batch export could fail on its last request.
- **Create Record works.** The Record Editor's create mode lists the layout's fields, has a **Create Record** button with a confirmation, and shows the new record's ID.
- **Trust a private or self-signed server without switching checks off.** The wizard shows the server's certificate (who it is for, its dates and SHA-256 fingerprint) and, if you agree, trusts exactly that certificate for the connection. A different certificate later is refused, with every value of VS Code's `http.proxySupport` setting (see [What pinning does and does not give you](#what-pinning-does-and-does-not-give-you)). See [Certificates](#certificates).
- **Test Connection names the failing step** (reaching the Data API, listing the databases, signing in), and the status bar shows the connection's real state. Connection errors say what happened and what to do. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
- **Show Effective Settings** and clearer User versus Workspace settings (three badges). See [User settings vs Workspace settings](#user-settings-vs-workspace-settings-in-plain-words).
- **About / Show Version** shows the version and build, with **Copy for bug report**. See [Which version am I running?](#which-version-am-i-running).
- **One session renewal.** When a session expires while several requests run, they now share one renewal instead of each opening a new FileMaker session.

Changes you may notice (details in the [upgrade notes](../UPGRADE.md)):

- Editing, creating, deleting and uploading records and the Script Runner now need a trusted workspace, and **Delete Record** also needs record editing to be switched on.
- A repository can no longer loosen your policy. Enterprise mode, the role, offline mode and the `filemaker.features.*.enabled` switches from a workspace can only make things stricter.
- You are asked before the extension runs a workspace plugin, runs `npm install` for the FM Web preview, runs a Layout Mode script, or sends credentials to an address that came from the workspace or uses plain `http://`.
- The connection wizard asks you to enter the password again when you change the server address, proxy address or user name. **Test Connection** no longer touches the saved profile's secrets.
- CSV exports and **Copy results as table** put a leading apostrophe (`'`) in front of text that starts with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, a tab or a carriage return, so a spreadsheet does not run it as a formula. `filemaker.export.neutralizeFormulas` (user settings) turns that off. A CSV export can be edited and imported back.
- The FM Web live preview is not in the Marketplace build; it needs the repository. Layout Mode is unchanged.
- Generated type files for layouts with spaces or punctuation in the name get a new file name (with a short hash). Delete the old files.
- Failed sign-ins no longer repeat by themselves: after FileMaker rejects the saved account or password the extension pauses automatic sign-ins until you edit the connection, or run **Connect** or **Test Connection**.
- Redirects are not followed, and a reply that is not the Data API (a web page) gets its own error message.
- A batch update carries on past records your account cannot change and stops only when the account cannot do updates at all.
- Logs and error details hide more secrets (session tokens in URLs, more token-like keys, passwords in URLs).
- A status bar item `AI: off` is always shown, on the right. Selecting it switches AI tools off when they are on. When AI is not on, it only explains why (for example `filemaker.ai.enabled` is off, offline mode, an untrusted workspace, enterprise policy, or no connection enabled) and offers **Open AI Settings**; it does not change anything.

### New in 1.6

These changes came after 1.5.0 (details in the [upgrade notes](../UPGRADE.md)):

- **Layout Mode standards.** Standard field sizes and spacing, an action that arranges the selection into a standard form, one that standardizes it (each undone in one step), and blank, form, two-column and first-portal starter templates for a new web layout. Fields are listed in FileMaker's field order.
- **One look for fields.** The find form, Record Editor, Record Viewer and generated web layout views use the same field sizes, top labels and spacing as Layout Mode. Generated FM Web apps get their managed runtime files refreshed (template version 3) the next time you generate or preview; see [FM Web and Layout Mode](#fm-web-and-layout-mode) for what happens to a file you edited.
- **Trusting a certificate and VS Code's network setting.** Trusted certificates work on direct routes without changing `http.proxySupport`, including `override`. CA-only profiles keep their existing proxy routing; older allow-self-signed profiles go direct unless an environment proxy applies, where their behavior is unchanged. See [Certificates](#certificates).
- **Smaller fixes:** script runs return only the script's answer, names `.` and `..` are refused, copy-as-code is more exact, profile changes in another window show up within two seconds, and new context and runtime files are readable by you only.

### New in 1.5

These changes came after 1.4.0 (details in the [upgrade notes](../UPGRADE.md)):

- **`@filemaker` in the Chat view.** A read-only participant: `/layouts`, `/describe`, `/find`, `/explain` and `/help`, under the same AI settings, approvals, limits and kill switch as the AI tools. See [Chat with @filemaker](#chat-with-filemaker).
- **Copy a request as code, everywhere.** curl, fetch(), a `.http` file, a Postman collection and TypeScript, from the Query Builder, Script Runner, Record Viewer, Record Editor and the new **FileMaker: Copy Request as Code…** command. See [Copy a request as code](#copy-a-request-as-code).
- **Scripts run with the request the Claris guide documents.** A `GET` with `script.param` in the address, one request that reads no record. See [Run scripts](#run-scripts).
- **Names are used exactly as typed or listed.** A leading or trailing space is part of a layout, script or field name and is no longer removed. See [Names are used exactly](#names-are-used-exactly).
- **Restricted Mode notice in the connection wizard**, panels that fit narrow editors, a Record Editor note when your account cannot see some fields, and a Record Viewer that loads the record it was opened for.
- **Windows and Linux** fixes found by running the tests on both (updating a read-only file, matching folder names regardless of letter case, the MCP shim on Windows). See [Windows, Linux and macOS](#windows-linux-and-macos).

## Install

1. Open the Extensions view (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
2. Search for **FileMaker Data API Tools** (publisher **SureForgeTech**) and select **Install**.

From a terminal: `code --install-extension SureForgeTech.filemaker-data-api-tools`.

To install a specific version from a file, download the `.vsix` from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/releases), then run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** in VS Code. A VSIX does not update itself. Check the version number on the release page: the Marketplace always has the newest build.

To check the install, open the Command Palette and type `FileMaker:`. Run **FileMaker: Open Getting Started Walkthrough** for a short guided tour.

---

## Connect to a server

A **connection profile** holds the server address, the database name and how you sign in. Profiles belong to your VS Code install and follow you between workspaces. Passwords never go into a settings file.

![The connection wizard filled in with example values](./marketplace/connection-setup.png)

### Add a profile

1. Run **FileMaker: Add Connection Profile** (or select the plus icon in the FileMaker sidebar). The connection wizard opens in an editor tab.
2. Fill in **Profile**: a name such as `Dev Server`.
3. Choose **Direct** or **Proxy**:
   - **Direct**: the extension talks straight to the FileMaker Data API. Enter the server URL (for example `https://fm.example.com`), the database name (the file name without `.fmp12`), the account name and the password.
   - **Proxy**: your team runs a middleware service in front of FileMaker. Enter the server URL the proxy talks to, the database name, the proxy endpoint, and the proxy API key if it needs one. The extension never sees the FileMaker credentials in this mode.
4. Leave **API Base Path** (`/fmi/data`) and **API Version** (`vLatest`) alone unless your administrator says otherwise. They are under the advanced server options.
5. Select **Test Connection**. A badge shows the result: green for a successful test, red with the error message for a failure, yellow if you changed something since the last test.
6. Select **Save Profile**. A notification offers **Connect Now**; select it to open a session.

How strict the wizard is about testing is set by `filemaker.connectionWizard.requireTestBeforeSave`: `off`, `warn` (the default: asks you to confirm when you save an untested profile) or `block`.

### Where secrets go

The password, proxy API key and session token are stored in VS Code SecretStorage, which uses your operating system's keychain. They are not written to settings, profiles, saved queries, snapshots or logs. If SecretStorage is not available (for example a Linux machine without a keyring), connecting fails with an error. `filemaker.secrets.fallback` lets you choose a fallback in VS Code workspace storage (`workspace-state`) for headless setups. That fallback is **obfuscated, not protected**: the key is derived from the machine ID, so anyone who can read your VS Code state on this machine can recover the secrets. Use it only when there is no keyring. This setting is read from your user settings only (a workspace value is ignored). The default is `vscode-only`.

### What the wizard asks you to confirm

- **Plain `http://` to a remote server.** The password would travel unencrypted. You can continue, but you are warned.
- **An address that came from the workspace.** See profile templates below.
- **A changed server, proxy or user name.** When you edit a saved profile and change the server address, the proxy address or the account name, the wizard does not reuse the saved password or API key. Type it again. This stops a saved password from being sent to a different server. If you only change the profile name or the database, the saved secret is kept.
- **Test Connection** opens a throwaway session and closes it. It never changes the saved profile's secrets. For an unchanged server and user, leave the password empty to test with the saved one.

When editing a profile, **••••••• (saved)** in the password box means you can leave it empty to keep the saved password. Typing a password replaces it when you save, including any spaces you type; the saved password is never displayed. If you have not tested the current values, Save shows **Test the connection first, or choose Save anyway** with a **Save anyway** button. A workplace policy that requires a successful test still blocks saving until it passes.

Changing the host or port clears the trusted certificate in the wizard and shows a notice. Review the certificate for the new address before trusting it.

Server addresses with a user name or password inside them (`https://user:pass@host`) are rejected.

### Certificates

Unless a profile still has the older allow-self-signed setting (see below), the extension checks the server's TLS certificate the normal way: it must be signed by an authority your computer trusts, be current, and match the name in the Server URL. Your computer's trust list is Node's built-in public list, plus (where your VS Code's Node can read it, Node 22.15 or newer) the operating system's certificate store, plus anything in the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable. The operating system store is read in the background after start-up and read again by the next request once ten minutes have passed (a certificate you install later is picked up then, or after a reload); set VS Code's `http.systemCertificates` to `false` to opt out. To see which Node your VS Code uses, run **FileMaker: About / Show Version** and read the **Extension host** line (`Node 22.15` or newer can read the operating system store). A certificate from a public authority needs nothing from you.

For a server whose certificate your computer does not trust there are two choices, both set in the connection wizard and stored per profile (never from a profile template or a workspace file, and only for `https://` addresses):

- **Trust this certificate (pinning).** Select **Test Connection**; when it meets a certificate problem the extension reads the certificate (it sends nothing to the server first) and shows **Trust this certificate for "<profile>"?** with: why it was refused, the **Server**, **Subject**, **Issuer**, **Names**, **Valid** dates and the **SHA-256** fingerprint. Only continue if you recognise the fingerprint; compare it with your administrator's or the Admin Console. If you accept, the extension trusts exactly that one certificate for this connection (host-name and issuer checks are skipped for it only) and the test runs again. The fingerprint is saved in the profile when you select **Save Profile**. If you decline, the red message stays with a **Trust this certificate…** button so you can reopen the dialog. You can also open it with **Review server certificate…** and remove the pin with **Forget trusted certificate**, both under **Certificates (advanced)**. On an error message for a saved connection the same button appears.
  - A pinned certificate that has **expired** (or is not yet valid) is refused, unless you accepted that explicitly in the dialog (the button then reads **Trust anyway, although it is not valid**).
  - If the server later presents a **different certificate** (renewed or replaced, or something else answering), the connection fails hard with a message that the certificate is not the one you trusted, and the button reads **Review and re-trust**. Do that only if your administrator renewed the certificate.
  - A pinned connection is made **directly, never through an HTTP proxy**. If a proxy applies to the server address on your computer (an environment proxy, VS Code's proxy, or a system/PAC rule), the extension refuses before sending anything: "A proxy is configured on this computer ... and a trusted (pinned) server certificate cannot be checked through a proxy". For an environment proxy, add the server's host name to `NO_PROXY` (and restart VS Code so it sees the change). For a VS Code or system proxy, exclude the server in that proxy's settings, or remove the proxy setting. The review dialog notes that it connects directly.
  - Trusted certificates work with all four values of VS Code's **http.proxySupport** setting: `override` (the default), `fallback`, `on` and `off`. No setting change is needed. A required proxy is refused with `PIN_THROUGH_PROXY`, even if the profile also has a CA file. The backup `fallback` advice is reserved for untrusted pin/legacy requests left on the environment-proxy route while the host patch is active; CA-only failures keep the normal certificate advice and trust actions.
- **Custom CA certificate file.** Under **Certificates (advanced)**, the absolute path to a PEM file with the certificate of the authority that signed your server's certificate (and any intermediate). It is added to the certificates your computer already trusts (Node's built-in list, plus the operating system store and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` where Node 22.15 or newer can read them; on an older Node with a CA file set, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` is not included), so public servers keep working, and an edited or renewed file is used on the next connection. This is the right choice for a company authority whose certificate names the server. **It does not help with FileMaker's default certificate** (no host names), and a profile that has a pinned certificate ignores the CA file and follows the pin's direct-only rules. CA-only profiles keep the same certificate handling and environment, VS Code and system/PAC proxy routing as before, including with `http.proxySupport: override`. Use the company CA file for a TLS-inspecting corporate proxy. A wrong CA file produces the normal untrusted-chain or missing-intermediate advice, with the network code and trust actions retained; changing `http.proxySupport` is not the remedy for a wrong CA file.

#### What pinning does and does not give you

A pin is trust on first use of **one** certificate fingerprint. It does not prove who presented the certificate at the moment you first trusted it: if someone was intercepting your connection then (a man-in-the-middle), their certificate is the one that gets pinned. It does not protect you if someone else holds that certificate's private key. For that one certificate it skips the host-name, issuer and revocation checks. So compare the SHA-256 in the dialog with your administrator's (or the Admin Console's) before you trust it, and do it on a network you trust. What it does give you is detection of change: a different certificate later is a hard failure. This also holds with VS Code's default `http.proxySupport` setting. It is not known whether FileMaker Server's default certificate is the same on every installation; if it is, pinning it detects change only.

Profiles that had the older **Allow self-signed certificate** setting now go directly to the server when no environment proxy applies, preserving their agent with every `http.proxySupport` value, including `override`. That agent skips every certificate check unless the profile also has a trusted fingerprint (the fingerprint takes priority). Behind an environment proxy these profiles keep their previous proxy CONNECT tunnel: VS Code may still replace the agent and reject an untrusted certificate, in which case the error may suggest `fallback`. This proxy behavior is unchanged. The profile list shows `no TLS checks` next to the profile, the status bar item carries a warning marker and tooltip, the wizard shows **This connection skips ALL certificate checks**, and the extension offers once to convert it: **Convert to pinned certificate** (it shows the certificate dialog first), or in the wizard **Convert to a pinned certificate…** or **Check certificates normally**. The wizard no longer has a checkbox for it; trust the certificate by fingerprint instead, and set a CA file only in the wizard. Converting does not require a VS Code setting change; a pinned connection must go directly to the server, without a proxy.

### Test Connection, step by step

**Test Connection** in direct mode is a ladder and tells you which step failed:

1. **Step 1 of 3: reaching the Data API.** TLS (the certificate), the name and port, and `/productInfo`, which needs no account. A failure here reads "Could not reach the Data API: ..." followed by the cause. On success the message names the server product and version.
2. **Step 2 of 3: listing the hosted databases.** "Could not list the hosted databases: ..." on failure. If sign-in later fails because the database name is wrong, the message lists the names the server hosts. (A server that answers 401 or 403 to the database list, because it filters the list until you sign in, is skipped, not treated as a failure.)
3. **Step 3 of 3: signing in.** "Reached the server, but sign-in failed: ..." on failure.

In proxy mode the test opens a session through the proxy. A failed test shows its reason once, in the message under the badge. A test is you asking for a sign-in, so it goes ahead even while automatic sign-ins are paused.

### Test my server

Choose your connection, then run **FileMaker: Test My Server**. The first dialog lists every check. Choose **Run read-only test** to start safely. This uses the saved account and password, in a separate temporary session, and leaves your normal connection alone.

The test checks the server version, signs in, tries the database list, counts layouts and scripts, and reads the fields of the first three layouts. A database list that your account cannot see is a warning, not a failed login. Choose a layout to read at most one record using Get records, without sending an empty search, and read it by its ID; the last layout you chose is remembered for that connection. Then choose a text field for a search that should find nothing. This records the server's actual answer, including whether “no records match” uses HTTP 404 or 500 with FileMaker code 401. Cancel a picker to skip that check. No record values or script results go into the report.

**Optional write test.** Only choose **Also run the write test** with a disposable test file. Pick a **SCRATCH layout** and an editable text field. A second dialog names that layout and asks permission to create, read, edit and delete one record. The test also tries an old modification ID to see whether the server refuses it with code 306. Required fields, automatic fields and server triggers can affect this test. Cleanup is attempted if a step fails or you cancel. If deletion fails, the report gives the record ID and layout: ask your administrator to remove that test record. If a create request times out, the server may have created a record without returning its ID; check the scratch layout before trying again.

**Optional script.** This is skipped by default: leave the script name blank or cancel. To run one, type its exact name and parameter (the parameter can be blank), then confirm the named script. Only use a script you understand: it may change data or have other effects. Layout, field and script names keep their spaces exactly as entered.

Writes and scripts are unavailable in Restricted Mode, when the enterprise role or policy blocks them, or when their Record Editor or Script Runner switch is off. Offline mode prevents the test. You can cancel from the progress notification; further tests stop, with cleanup and logout still attempted. Requests use your normal timeout setting. Even reads may cause server-side triggers or automatic actions, so use a test file first. Containers and batches are never tested.

Cancelling a request while signing in stops only that request; other waiting requests continue. When the extension renews a direct connection, it tries to close the previous session with a short timeout. A failed close does not fail your request; the old session then expires on the server.

The Get records step needs a direct connection; the existing proxy protocol has no action to list records without a search.

The test signs out and tries the old token once, without signing back in, to check that it is refused. A proxy owns its own sessions, so that last check is skipped for proxy connections. The report opens as an unsaved Markdown document. **PASS** means that step answered as expected; **WARN** means skipped or not confirmed; **FAIL** means it needs attention. It shows elapsed time, HTTP status, FileMaker code and message, observed facts and plain next steps. A TLS protocol is only shown when it was observed; plain HTTP has no TLS. Blank status or code means none was observed, never an assumed success.

Choose **Copy report** or **Copy report with server address hidden** after it opens. Passwords, tokens, record values, script parameters and script results are excluded, and the report is scrubbed again before copying. Review it before sharing: layout and field names and server details can still identify your organization. Real server findings describe only the server you tested; mock-server results do not verify other servers.

### Profile templates for a team

A repository can include `.filemaker/profile-template.json` to pre-fill the wizard for everyone who clones it:

```json
{
  "name": "Team Development",
  "authMode": "direct",
  "serverUrl": "https://fm-dev.example.com",
  "database": "TeamApp",
  "apiBasePath": "/fmi/data",
  "apiVersionPath": "vLatest",
  "username": "developer",
  "locked": true
}
```

For a proxy profile use `"authMode": "proxy"` and `"proxyEndpoint"` instead of `"username"`. A template must not contain secrets: a `password`, `proxyApiKey`, token or any unsupported field makes the extension ignore the whole template and show a warning. Everyone enters their own password in the wizard.

`"locked": true` makes the database name, API base path and API version read-only in the wizard. The server address and proxy endpoint are never locked, so you can always see and change where your credentials go.

**Why a repository's template is not trusted:** it names the server your credentials will be sent to, and a cloned repository could name a server owned by someone else. So:

- In an **untrusted workspace** the template is ignored.
- In a trusted workspace the wizard names the address on a banner, and asks you to confirm before it saves or tests credentials against an address that came from the template. It does not ask if you already have a profile for that server.

### Connect, disconnect and switch

- **FileMaker: Connect** opens a session. If you have several profiles, you choose one. A transient failure (network error, server error) is retried with growing delays (`filemaker.connect.*` settings).
- **FileMaker: Disconnect** closes the session.
- The status bar item `FileMaker: <profile>` shows the active profile. Select it for **FileMaker: Show Connection Menu** (switch profile, disconnect).
- Data commands use the active profile, or your only profile, without asking. With no profile, they offer to add one.
- **FileMaker: Edit Connection Profile** and **FileMaker: Remove Connection Profile** (also on the profile's right-click menu) change or delete a profile. Removing a profile also deletes its saved queries and secrets.

Press `Escape` in any picker or input box to cancel the command.

### Sessions

Renewing a connection lets the next request proceed as soon as the new session is ready. Closing the previous session happens in the background.

FileMaker Data API tokens expire after about 15 minutes of inactivity. The extension renews the token about 30 seconds early (`filemaker.session.refreshLeadSeconds`) and treats a token as expired after 14 minutes (`filemaker.session.maxAgeMinutes`). If a request is still rejected as unauthorized, it signs in again once and retries, and reports an error only if that fails too.

**Failed sign-ins pause.** If FileMaker rejects the saved account or password (error 210, 211, 212, 213, 214 or 1703), the extension stops signing in on its own for that connection, so that repeated failures cannot lock the account. Every action then reports "Sign-in is paused" with the error code. (Error 214, too many login attempts, can be a temporary lockout: wait before trying again.) To resume, edit the connection and save a corrected account or password, or run **FileMaker: Connect** or **Test Connection**. If the server has no free Data API sessions (error 956), automatic sign-ins wait 30 seconds, then 60, and so on up to 5 minutes.

**Status bar.** The `FileMaker: <profile>` item shows the real state of the last request: it only says the profile is active until a request has been made ("the connection has not been checked"), then a spinning icon while connecting, a plug when connected, `sign-in failed`, `certificate problem` or `unreachable`. A profile that still skips all certificate checks (the older setting) carries a warning marker and tooltip there. `unreachable` appears for a connection that could not be made, but also for a plain 404, a 5xx without a FileMaker error code, a gateway error (502, 503, 504) and a reply that is not Data API JSON; a cancelled request leaves the last state.

**Not the Data API.** If a web page, firewall block page, empty reply or cut-off reply comes back instead of FileMaker's JSON, you get "The server did not return Data API JSON" with the HTTP status and content type. Redirects are not followed (the Data API never redirects); the message says where the server pointed.

---

## The FileMaker sidebar

The FileMaker icon in the activity bar opens two views.

**Connections** shows:

```
Connections
  Environment Sets          (only when you have created one)
  Jobs                      (while batch jobs exist)
  <Profile name>
    <Layout>
      Fields
      Value Lists
      Schema Snapshots
    Saved Queries
```

Right-click a layout for the common actions: open the Query Builder, open or edit a record, run a script, capture or diff a schema snapshot, generate types, batch export, batch update, upload to a container. Right-click a profile to connect, edit, remove or generate types for all layouts.

**Layout Inspector** shows the fields, portals, value lists and field validation rules of one layout. Select a layout in Connections, or run **FileMaker: Select Layout for Inspector**.

![The FileMaker sidebar with a connection, a layout, its fields and the Layout Inspector](./marketplace/explorer.png)

**FileMaker: Refresh Connections** reloads the tree. **FileMaker: Refresh Schema Cache** drops the cached layout metadata (kept for `filemaker.schema.cacheTtlSeconds`, default 300 seconds).

### Names are used exactly

Layout, script and field names are sent to FileMaker exactly as the server lists them or as you type them. A leading or trailing space is part of the name, so the layouts `Sales` and ` Sales` (with a space in front) are two layouts, the sidebar lists both, and choosing one never turns into the other. This holds in the Query Builder (find and sort fields), Script Runner, container upload, global fields, saved queries, type generation, Layout Mode and the AI tool that runs scripts. For scripts and layouts, only an empty name or one that is all spaces is refused. A name that is just `.` or `..` is refused for a script or layout, because a web address would resolve it away and send a different request. Generated file names and TypeScript identifiers for such names stay different from each other (see [file names](#generate-types-a-client-and-snippets)).

If a name seems not to work, check for a space at either end: copy it from the sidebar rather than typing it.

Some commands are hidden from the Command Palette until you need them:

- Most data commands appear after you have at least one profile.
- Environment Set commands appear only in [enterprise mode](#enterprise-mode-and-roles).
- Jobs, request history, the diagnostics dashboard, circuit breaker and plugin commands appear only when `filemaker.advanced.powerUserMode` is on.

---

## Find records: Query Builder

1. Run **FileMaker: Open Query Builder**, or right-click a layout and choose it.
2. Pick the **Profile** and the **Layout**.
3. On the **Form** tab, build the find: choose a field (field names autocomplete), a condition, and a value. Conditions include *matches*, *equals (whole field)*, *begins with*, *contains phrase*, *greater than*, *at least*, *less than*, *at most*, *between*, *is empty* and *is not empty*.
4. Select **Add request (OR)** for an alternative set of criteria. Tick **Omit** on a request to exclude its matches. Use **Add sort field** to sort.
5. Select **Run** (or press `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter`).

![The Query Builder after a find: Status Open and Region East, sorted by last name](./marketplace/query-builder.png)

The **JSON** tab shows the same request as a Data API find body, and you can edit it directly. For example, `[{ "Status": "Active", "City": "Portland" }]` means Active AND Portland; `[{ "City": "Portland" }, { "City": "Seattle" }]` means Portland OR Seattle; a request with `"omit": "true"` excludes its matches.

Results:

- The table shows `Showing 1-100 of N found`. Use **Previous page** and **Next page**, and set **Records per page** and **Start at record** (the first record is 1).
- Select a column heading to sort the current page. Double-click a row, or use **View** or **Edit**, to open that record.
- Under the **Export** disclosure: **Copy results as table** copies text that pastes into a spreadsheet, and **Save results as CSV…**, **Save results as JSON…** and **Open results in editor** export the results on screen. Both **Save results as CSV…** and **Copy results as table** put an apostrophe in front of text that a spreadsheet would run as a formula (see [apostrophes in CSV files](#batch-export-and-batch-update)); `filemaker.export.neutralizeFormulas` turns that off. For large exports use [batch export](#batch-export-and-batch-update).
- Under the **Copy request** disclosure: **Copy as curl**, **Copy as fetch()**, **Copy as .http (REST Client)**, **Copy as Postman collection**, **Copy as TypeScript** and **Save as .http file…** copy the find you have entered. The session token, password and API key are never copied; the Authorization header carries a variable to fill in once you tick **Include auth header** (its starting value is `filemaker.snippets.includeAuthByDefault`). See [Copy a request as code](#copy-a-request-as-code).
- A find that matches nothing shows an empty result, not an error.

**Save…** stores the query under the profile in the sidebar (**Saved Queries**). Saved queries live in the workspace by default; set `filemaker.savedQueries.scope` to `global` to keep them in your user data. Run one from its right-click menu or **FileMaker: Run Saved Query**. **FileMaker: Export Saved Queries (JSON)** and **FileMaker: Import Saved Queries (JSON)** share them with a team. The panel keeps a short **Request history**, the last `filemaker.history.maxEntries` requests (default 10).

**Empty searches.** Enter at least one field value to search. An empty form, `[]`, or `[{}]` is refused before searching; it does not mean “all records.” This also applies to saved queries, batch exports, AI searches, generated clients and copied code. To search for an empty field, choose **is empty** (the `=` search value). Get records lists records without searching; Test My Server uses it to read one record. FM Web’s **Find All** also uses Get records through the local preview bridge.

For a quick check without the panel, **FileMaker: Run Find (JSON)** asks for a layout and a find body.

---

## View, edit, create and delete records

### What a record ID is

A **record ID** is FileMaker's internal record number for a row on a layout (what `Get ( RecordID )` returns in FileMaker). It is not one of your key fields and it is not the order of the records on screen. The Query Builder results table shows it in the first column (`recordId`). You rarely need to type one: run a find in the Query Builder and use **View** or **Edit** on the row. The commands that ask for a record ID are for when you already have it from a result, a log or a script.

### View a record

Run **FileMaker: Get Record by ID** or **FileMaker: Open Record Viewer**, choose a profile and layout, and enter the record ID (or use **View** on a row in the Query Builder). The viewer shows the fields, portal data and container fields (container URLs are shown as text; images are not previewed). **Export Record JSON** saves the record.

If **Load more** in the Record Viewer fails, the error is shown and the button becomes available to try again. Portal counts supplied only for the first result are not applied to other records in a search or CSV export.

### Edit a record

![The Record Editor with record 1003 loaded](./marketplace/record-editor.png)

1. Run **FileMaker: Open Record Editor** or **FileMaker: Edit Record by ID**, or select **Edit** in the Query Builder.
2. Choose a profile and layout and enter the record ID, or skip this and use **Edit** on a row in the Query Builder (the editor then opens with the record loaded). In the editor, **Load** fetches the record.
3. Change fields. **Validate** checks the values. **Preview Update JSON** shows exactly what will be sent.
4. Select **Save**. A dialog lists the fields that will change. Confirm with **Save**.

Only changed fields are sent. **Discard Changes** reverts the form.

**If someone else changed the record:** the editor sends the version of the record you loaded. If the record changed on the server since then, FileMaker refuses the edit (error 306) and nothing is written. The editor then shows which fields changed since you loaded the record, which of them you also edited, and keeps your edits in the form. Select **Reload record (discard my edits)** to load the current version, then make your change again. Batch updates also use the modification ID kept in your export, unless you explicitly choose to overwrite newer changes.

If the layout runs a script on save and that script reports an error, the error is shown next to the success message (the record was saved). The same applies to create and delete. A find (**Run Find (JSON)** and the Query Builder) and a container upload also show a script error as a warning ("The find worked, but ...", "The upload worked, but ..."); getting a single record does not display script errors.

If a save works but the editor cannot re-read the record afterwards, it says so and asks you to select **Load** before editing again.

### Create a record

Run **FileMaker: Create Record** (or the plus icon on a layout). The Record Editor opens in create mode with the layout's field list. Fill in the fields you want, select **Create Record**, and confirm the dialog ("Create a new record in layout ..."). The editor then shows the new record's ID.

### Delete a record

Run **FileMaker: Delete Record**, choose a profile and layout, and enter the record ID. Because a mistyped ID deletes the wrong record, look the ID up first: run a find in the Query Builder and read the `recordId` of the row you mean. A dialog then asks you to confirm with **Delete**, naming the ID and the layout. Deleting cannot be undone.

Editing, creating, deleting and uploading all need a trusted workspace (checked each time; an open editor refuses changes if trust is lost), are blocked in offline mode and for the enterprise `viewer` role, and respect `filemaker.features.recordEdit.enabled`. Deleting also needs the general write permission (`writeOperations`) in addition to record editing.

## Upload to a container field

1. Run **FileMaker: Upload to Container**, or select **Upload to container…** in the Query Builder.
2. Choose a profile and layout, then enter the record ID and the container field name.
3. Pick the file.

The default size limit is 100 MB (`filemaker.containerUploadMaxBytes`). Uploading needs a trusted workspace.

### Text with a NUL character and repeated field names

A NUL character (U+0000) is invisible and can arrive in pasted text. On the FileMaker server we tested, FileMaker kept only the text before this character and dropped the rest. This was observed with FileMaker Data API Engine on 2026-10-21.

Before saving or creating a record, the editor names the affected fields and asks you to choose **Remove the character and continue** or **Cancel**. Removing it keeps all the text on both sides and leaves other characters alone. If removal leaves a field empty, including all of its repeating values, the warning names it and tells you it will be sent as an empty value. You still confirm the save or creation afterwards, unless cleaned edit values match the original record; then the editor explains that nothing needs to be saved. Batch update/import refuses the whole affected row, reports its record ID and field names, and continues with the other rows. The dry-run preview document lists every flagged data row number (starting at 1, excluding a CSV header), record ID, and affected field names, including rows outside the sample. Remove the character in the source file before trying again. AI write tools and the FM Web preview bridge refuse the value and explain why. The shared client also refuses NUL values from other callers. Zero-width space and BOM alone were not tested on the real server; the extension does not remove them.

Some layouts list the same field more than once. The editor shows one value per name and a note naming repeated fields. Query Builder offers one choice per field name. The AI layout description also lists each exact name once and includes a note about repeats. Generated types have one property per name, copied requests keep the exact names, and Layout Inspector shows both occurrences.

**Known gap: creating related records.** FileMaker accepts related records when creating a record, but this extension's Create Record sends only the main record's fields. It cannot yet create portal rows. A real-server check created a related record in **Phone Numbers**, with **Phone Numbers::Number** and **Phone Numbers::Type**; that support has not been added to the extension.

When the layout field list is available, calculation and summary fields are disabled in the Record Editor with a note explaining why. Container fields are disabled with **Use Upload to container**; use the separate upload action. Save and Create Record leave these fields out, including repetitions such as `Calc(1)` and `Calc(2)`. The extension checks this again before sending a change. Global fields remain editable and show **Session-wide** because they apply throughout the connection session. Read-only fields keep the same standard field presentation. If the field list is unavailable, the editor warns that it cannot identify read-only fields; check the field types before saving. FileMaker still decides which fields your account can change.

## Batch export and batch update

Batch work runs as a **job** with a progress bar. Jobs appear under **Jobs** in the sidebar. Progress shows processed rows, succeeded rows and failed rows separately. A finished job with a failed row says **completed with 1 failed row**. Open the job to view details or choose **Copy failures** to copy record IDs, reasons and FileMaker codes.

Use **FileMaker: Cancel Job**, the Cancel action on a running job in the sidebar, or the jobs menu opened from the status bar. Cancellation stops new requests. Requests already sent finish, and their results and failed rows are kept. Cancelling does not undo successful updates.

After you cancel an update, its status stays **cancelling** while edits already sent finish. No further edit or retry starts. It then shows **Cancelled after N of M**; N counts records attempted, including failures. Open **FileMaker: Show Jobs** and choose the job to see `updatedIds`, `failures` (record IDs, reasons and FileMaker codes when supplied), and `notAttemptedIds`. The full lists stay available for this session. After a restart, recent jobs keep all counts and the first 1,000 entries in each list of changed, failed and untouched records. A shortened list is marked in the details; copy any full list you need before restarting. Cancelling does not undo changes.

### Export

1. Run **FileMaker: Batch Export (Find)** (or use the layout's right-click menu).
2. Enter the find JSON array and an optional sort array.
3. Choose where to save. The file extension sets the format: `.jsonl` (one JSON record per line) or `.csv`.

Large results are fetched page by page. The export stops at `filemaker.batch.maxRecords` records (default 10,000; the hard limit is 250,000). With `filemaker.performance.mode` set to `high-scale`, exports are always written as JSONL.

**Safe export files.** The extension writes a temporary file in the same folder and replaces your chosen file only when the export finishes successfully. A failed or cancelled export leaves the existing file untouched and removes the temporary file; no partial file is kept. A cancelled export says **Cancelled; no file was written**. A successful CSV export with no matches still has its column headings. New export files use owner-only permissions on macOS and Linux; replacements keep the existing file's permissions. A destination symlink is replaced without changing the file it points to. CSV includes repeating fields as `Name(1)`, `Name(2)`, etc., followed by any extra fields found in the first page. When field information is unavailable, CSV uses the columns found in the first 100 records. Fields appearing after the column list is fixed are omitted; the job result lists their names and the final warning reports how many values were not exported.

**CSV for Excel.** Choose **Standard CSV** for the usual UTF-8 file, or **Excel-compatible CSV (UTF-8 BOM)** so Excel on Windows recognizes accents. Standard CSV is the default. This choice is available for batch CSV exports and Query Builder's **Save results as CSV…**.

**Related rows in exports.** FileMaker often returns only the first 50 rows of each portal. CSV has a note column and JSONL has an `exportNote` when rows are missing, for example `Orders: showing 50 of 170`. These exports do not fetch the missing related rows. In the Record Viewer, each portal shows how many rows were returned out of the total. Choose **Load more** to request another 50, until all rows are shown. Portal names keep their spaces exactly. Loading more is available on direct connections; a proxy connection shows a message explaining this limit.

**Apostrophes in CSV files.** A spreadsheet runs a cell that starts with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` as a formula, and database text can start that way. The export therefore puts an apostrophe in front of such text, so `=SUM(A1)` is saved as `'=SUM(A1)`. The same applies to text that starts with a tab or a carriage return. Plain numbers (`-5`), signed numbers and phone numbers such as `+1 (555) 123-4567` are left alone. If another program reads the CSV, strip the leading apostrophe there. The same applies to **Save results as CSV…** and **Copy results as table** in the Query Builder.

**Editing and re-importing a CSV export.** The first two CSV columns identify the record: `recordId` and `modId`. If a layout has a field with either name (including different capitals), the record columns use `__recordId` and `__modId` instead. Extra underscores are used if those names are also fields. Keep these two columns together at the start of the file. The layout fields follow, including fields missing from the first record. Duplicate column names are refused because the record or field to change would be unclear. An older CSV using plain record columns on a layout with clashing field names is also refused when the field list can be read; export it again to get the reserved columns. The last column, `__portalNote (export information)`, is a note about missing related rows, not a field; import skips it. Keep that note last or remove it before importing.

Text fields keep exactly what you typed, including `10.50`, `null`, `true`, brackets and spaces. Number fields receive numbers only for valid decimal numbers within the safe range (up to 9,007,199,254,740,991 in either direction). Other number entries are kept as text, with a warning for each affected row in the job log, so large numbers are not rounded. Dates and times stay as written. Field types are checked once when the update job starts; if they cannot be read, values stay as text and the job log warns you. Empty CSV cells are still skipped: they leave the field unchanged, so a CSV cannot clear a field. A space in a text cell is kept as a space. The Record Editor also uses the field's type, keeping number-looking text as text.

Calculation, summary and container columns are skipped when the layout field list can be read, including repeating columns such as `Calc(1)` and `Calc(2)`. The dry run and job log name each skipped column before updates; a row with no editable values is skipped without a write. Remove related (`Table::Field`) columns before importing, keeping only fields you want to change. If the same record ID appears more than once, only its first row is used; later rows are listed as duplicate rows and skipped, with a warning. Spaces around CSV modification IDs are ignored; field names and values are kept exactly. JSONL files cannot be imported; batch update accepts comma-separated CSV or a JSON array of updates. A semicolon-separated file or JSONL file gets a message asking for comma-separated CSV instead.

**Turning the apostrophe off.** If you need the raw text (for example a program that does not understand the apostrophe), set `filemaker.export.neutralizeFormulas` to `false` in your **user** settings. It applies to CSV exports and **Copy results as table**; a workspace cannot change it. JSON Lines exports never had the apostrophe.

### Update

Rows containing a NUL character are refused before sending any fields from that row; see [Text with a NUL character and repeated field names](#text-with-a-nul-character-and-repeated-field-names).

1. Run **FileMaker: Batch Update from CSV/JSON** (or the layout's right-click menu).
2. Choose a `.csv` or `.json` file.
   - **CSV**: a header row with a `recordId` column and one column per field. Empty cells are skipped (a CSV cannot clear a field).
   - **JSON**: an array of `{ "recordId": "123", "modId": "7", "fieldData": { "Field": "value" } }` entries (`recordId` and `modId` are strings). Keep `modId` from the export when available.
3. Choose **Dry-run only (recommended)** or **Execute updates now**. A dry run shows a sample, how many rows have `modId`, how many will be checked for newer changes, and calculation, summary and container columns that will be skipped. The sample and NUL warnings leave out skipped columns. The preview opens after the field check without switching focus; if it cannot open, the result remains in Jobs. It sends no updates. Executing asks for confirmation first.

**Protect newer changes.** Keep the exported `modId` column (or reserved `__modId`) unchanged. Choose **Check for newer changes (recommended)** before running. FileMaker checks each row's version; if someone edited that record after the export, the row fails with code **306** and “Changed since the export (someone edited this record). Not updated.” It is not retried, and other rows continue. Jobs and **Copy failures** include these rows and their code. If a reply is lost and a retry receives 306, the extension reads the record again. If all values being written already match, it counts the row as successful. Otherwise, or if it cannot read the record, it says **Could not confirm: the first attempt may have succeeded**. Check that record before trying again; this is not counted as a record changed by someone else. The final job summary says how many rows were skipped because the records changed after the export. To replace newer values deliberately, choose **Overwrite even if changed**; this sends no modification ID.

If the file has no modification IDs, a warning asks **Continue** or **Cancel** before any update. Continuing cannot detect newer changes. In a file with some missing IDs, the choice lists how many rows cannot be checked. A dry run reports these counts without asking to write anything.

A record your account cannot change because of a record-level access rule (error 200) fails that record only, with its reason in the failure list, and the job carries on. The job stops once, with FileMaker's reason and the number of records not attempted, only for errors that mean the account cannot do updates at all (9 insufficient privileges, 205 no privilege to create records, 207 no privilege to change the schema, or rejected credentials). Batch update does not retry FileMaker's own errors; it retries only connection and gateway problems, a locked record (301) and 429 or 503 answers, waiting for the server's `Retry-After`.

Updates run with `filemaker.batch.concurrency` requests at a time (default 4, maximum 10). There is no undo. The modification ID check protects newer edits when their exported IDs are kept. Keep an export from before the update for reference; restoring old values is another update, with the same checks and field limits.

Batch update is blocked in offline mode, for the `viewer` role, and when `filemaker.features.batch.enabled` is off or the workspace is untrusted.

---

While a query, script, record load, save or creation is running, its button is disabled. Repeated clicks do not start extra requests. A failed query or script clears the old results and summary so they cannot be mistaken for the latest answer.

An omit request with a criterion can be used on its own. Verified on a real server (2026-10-21): `{"query":[{"Last Name":"==Smith","omit":"true"}]}` returned all other records. An empty find is rejected with code 400; use Get records to list records without a search.

## Run scripts

1. Run **FileMaker: Open Script Runner** (or use a layout's right-click menu).
2. Choose a profile and a layout. FileMaker runs scripts in the context of a layout.
3. Type the script name exactly as it appears in FileMaker. Add a record ID and a parameter if the script needs them. **Build Parameter** helps you assemble a JSON parameter.
4. Select **Run Script**. The result appears below. Under **Copy request** the same formats as in the Query Builder copy the request without running it (see [Copy a request as code](#copy-a-request-as-code)).

**What is sent.** The script runs with the request the Claris Data API Guide documents for it: a `GET` of `.../layouts/<layout>/script/<script>?script.param=<parameter>`. It is one request and it reads no record. The script name, layout name and parameter are percent-encoded exactly (a space is `%20`, never `+`; accented letters, `|`, `&` and `/` arrive as typed). The answer carries the script's error number and, if the script exits with a result, that result; if a record or find was part of the request, its data is not shown.

**Parameter length.** The extension limits the complete percent-encoded web address to 2,000 characters, including the server address, layout, script name and parameter. Without a record ID, a longer parameter goes in a find body: the extension uses the first normal stored text field in the layout metadata, skipping global, summary and calculation fields, keeps its name exactly, searches for `*`, and limits the response to one record. An empty search cannot carry the parameter: FileMaker rejects it. Because `*` matches only non-empty values, a search with no matches is followed by a separate read of at most one record, without a script, to check whether the layout is empty. If records exist but that field is empty, or the layout has no suitable stored text field, the extension falls back to Get records limited to one record only when its complete encoded URL fits the same 2,000-character limit. Otherwise it says: "This parameter is too long to send. Shorten it or run the script from a layout with a text field". With a record ID, the script must use that record's URL; shorten a parameter that exceeds the limit, or clear the record ID and use a layout with a text field.

**Verified on a real server (2026-10-21).** A `POST /layouts/{layout}/_find` with `{"query":[{"<text field>":"*"}],"limit":1,"script":"<name>","script.param":"<3000 characters>"}` ran the script: HTTP 200 and `scriptError: "0"`. A find that matches no records returns code 401 and does **not** run the attached script; its response has no `scriptError`. After checking that the layout really has no visible records, the runner reports: "The script did not run because this layout has no records. Add a record or use a layout that has records." A `GET /layouts/{layout}/records?_limit=1&script=<name>&script.param=<1500 characters>` also worked. Both attached forms read records; the runner shows only the script's answer. An answer without `scriptError` is never treated as confirmed execution. If an older server refuses the script endpoint, a short call uses the Get records form too.

**With a record ID.** The script is attached to a request for that record (`?script=<name>&script.param=<parameter>`), because the script endpoint cannot take a record in context.

**Older servers.** If the server answers the script endpoint with 405, 501 or a FileMaker 404, the extension uses the attach-to-another-request form instead and, if that is refused too, says "Script runner is not supported on this server/profile." A bare 404 with no FileMaker error code means a wrong address or a Data API that is turned off, not unsupported scripts.

Script and layout names are used exactly as typed (see [Names are used exactly](#names-are-used-exactly)); a name that is only `.` or `..` is refused before anything is sent.

The Script Runner does not ask for confirmation, so check the script name before you run it. Running scripts is blocked in offline mode, for the `viewer` role, and when `filemaker.features.scriptRunner.enabled` is off. A workspace setting can only switch this off, never on.

## Copy a request as code

Any request the extension sends can be copied as text, to try it in a terminal, put it in a repository, share it with a colleague or move it to Postman. Nothing is sent when you copy.

![The Copy request menu open in the Query Builder](./marketplace/copy-as-code.png)

**Where.** Query Builder and Script Runner: **Copy request** (next to Export). Record Viewer and Record Editor: **Copy request for this record** (choose **Get**, **Edit** or **Delete**, and a format). Command Palette: **FileMaker: Copy Request as Code…** asks for the request (log in, find, get, create, edit, delete, run a script, list layouts, list scripts, layout metadata, container upload), then the layout and details it needs, then the format, for the active connection.

**Formats.**

| Format | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| curl | One `curl` command for a POSIX shell (sh, bash, zsh). Values are quoted so that nothing in a name can run as a command. |
| fetch() | A `fetch` call for Node 18 or later (top-level `await`) or a browser. |
| .http (REST Client) | A `.http` file for VS Code's REST Client (and other editors that read the `.http` convention) with an `@host` variable (and `@token` when **Include auth header** is ticked), one request after a `###` line. |
| Postman collection | A Postman v2.1 collection (JSON) with one request and the variable `baseUrl` (and `token` when **Include auth header** is ticked). Import it with **Import** in Postman. |
| TypeScript | A small typed `fetch` wrapper and the call, with the response typed. It stands alone: the client from **Generate TypeScript Client** needs generated types per layout and has no calls for sessions, scripts, modId or containers, so it is not used here. |

**Save as .http file…** opens the request in a new unsaved editor. Use **File > Save As** to put it where you want; the extension never writes a request into your workspace by itself.

**What is not included, ever.** The password, the session token and the API key. A request that needs them shows a placeholder:

| Format | Authorization header | Login (account name and password) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| curl | `Bearer <REDACTED>`, or with **Include auth header** `Bearer $FM_TOKEN` | `-u "$FM_USERNAME:$FM_PASSWORD"` |
| fetch(), TypeScript | `Bearer <REDACTED>`, or `process.env.FM_TOKEN` | `process.env.FM_USERNAME` and `FM_PASSWORD` |
| .http | `Bearer <REDACTED>`, or `Bearer {{token}}` | `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` |
| Postman | `Bearer <REDACTED>`, or `Bearer {{token}}` | the collection variables `username` and `password` (empty) |

**Include auth header** (and the setting `filemaker.snippets.includeAuthByDefault`) only changes the header from `<REDACTED>` to a variable you fill in: set `FM_TOKEN` in your shell, or `@token` in the `.http` file, to the token from the **Log in** request (its `response.token`). The extension does not offer to copy a live token. A proxy connection copies one `POST` to the proxy with `Bearer <REDACTED>` or `$FM_PROXY_API_KEY`.

**What is included.** The server address of the connection (the host, port and path; any account, query string or fragment typed into the address is dropped), the database, the layout and record in the address, and the find criteria, field values or script parameter you entered. Layout, field and script names are percent-encoded in the address exactly as the extension does it (`A/B` becomes `A%2FB`, `100%` becomes `100%25`). Text is escaped for the format, so a name with quotes, new lines, `$(...)`, a backtick or `</script>` cannot change the command or the file.

**Credential-looking text is replaced.** The same redaction as the logs is applied to the names and values you copy: text such as `Bearer abc…`, `password=…`, or a field called `token` or `password` is shown as `***`, and the copied request says so in a comment. Free text with no recognisable shape (a bare secret typed into a field value) cannot be recognised; check what you share.

**Details worth knowing.**

- **Run a script** is copied in the form the Claris Data API Guide documents: a `GET` of `.../layouts/<layout>/script/<script>?script.param=<text>`. With a record in context the script is attached to a `GET` of that record (`?script=<name>&script.param=<text>`). A parameter too long for an address (more than about 2000 characters with the server and script name) is refused; shorten it before copying.
- **Edit** carries `"modId": "<modId>"` (`{{modId}}` in `.http` and Postman). Put in the modId from the record you read: FileMaker refuses the edit with error 306 if the record changed since. The Record Editor copies the fields you changed in the form; without changes (and in the Record Viewer) it shows one field to fill in.
- **Delete** really deletes when sent. The copied text says so.
- **Container upload** is a multipart request with the file at `./file-to-upload`: change the path. Add the modId to the address for a checked upload.
- A `curl` command that has a comment line first (login, edit, upload) works in a script and in bash; some shells, such as an interactive zsh, print a harmless error for the `#` line when you paste it into the terminal.
- Copying works in an untrusted workspace (it only builds text).

**Examples.** A find, copied as `.http` with **Include auth header** ticked:

```http
@host = https://fm.example.com
@token = <session token>

### Find records in layout "Contacts"
POST {{host}}/fmi/data/vLatest/databases/Sales/layouts/Contacts/_find
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

{
  "query": [
    {
      "City": "Portland"
    }
  ],
  "limit": 25
}
```

The same find as curl (set `FM_TOKEN` first):

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://fm.example.com/fmi/data/vLatest/databases/Sales/layouts/Contacts/_find' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer $FM_TOKEN" --data-raw '{"query":[{"City":"Portland"}],"limit":25}'
```

## Schema snapshots and diffs

A snapshot records a layout's fields and metadata at a moment in time, so you can see what changed.

1. Right-click a layout and choose **Capture Schema Snapshot** (or run **FileMaker: Capture Schema Snapshot**).
2. Later, choose **Diff Against Latest Snapshot** on the layout, or **FileMaker: Diff Schema Snapshots** to compare any two.
3. The **Schema Diff** panel shows added, removed and changed fields side by side or as a tree. **Export Diff JSON** saves it.

![The Schema Diff panel with a field added and a field removed](./marketplace/schema-diff.png)

Layout names that contain `..` (for example `Q1..Q2`) are supported in snapshots and the offline cache. Snapshots are stored in `.vscode/filemaker/snapshots/` in a trusted workspace (`filemaker.schema.snapshots.storage` = `workspaceFiles`, the default), or in VS Code workspace storage in an untrusted one. The newest 20 per layout are kept (`filemaker.schema.snapshots.maxPerLayout`). Treat the files as internal project data: they contain your layout and field names.

With `filemaker.schema.diagnostics.enabled`, changes found by **Diff Against Latest Snapshot** are also listed in the Problems panel.

**FileMaker: Open Schema Snapshot JSON** opens a snapshot file.

---

Limit (records per page) and offset (starting record) must each be a whole number of at least 1. Zero is refused before sending a request.

If a create, edit, delete or script times out, **the change may have been applied**. Check the record before trying again; a script may still be running. The timeout shows tenths of a second (for example, 1.5 s), and these uncertain changes are not marked for automatic retry. HTTP 413 means to send a smaller file or fewer records. For HTTP 429, wait for the time shown in `Retry-After` before trying again. HTTP 500, 502 or 504 without a FileMaker code means server or proxy trouble: try later or ask the administrator to check the Admin Console. A FileMaker code in brackets has its own meaning: 500 is a date validation problem, 502 is a number validation problem, and 504 needs a unique value.

## Generate types, a client and snippets

Generation writes files, so it needs a **trusted workspace**. The client folder chooser starts at `.filemaker/generated/client`; choose another folder if needed. Types use the configured `filemaker-types` folder and snippets use `snippets`. Files never go into the workspace root unless you choose that folder.

Generated files have a header saying they were generated by FileMaker Data API Tools. Before replacing an existing file without this header, the extension names the files and offers **Overwrite**, **Skip existing**, or **Cancel**. Cancel stops that generation; Skip existing leaves those files alone. Review generated files before editing them: a later generation can refresh files that still have the header. AI context keeps its marked section separate from other text and asks before adding a section to an existing file. It refuses project document names such as `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. FM Web layout pages use the same overwrite choices; runtime template files that you edited continue to be skipped.

| Command | What it writes |
| --- | --- |
| **FileMaker: Generate Types for Layout** | `<output folder>/layouts/<layout file name>.ts`, a TypeScript interface for one layout |
| **FileMaker: Generate Types for All Layouts** | the same, for every layout. A layout whose metadata cannot be read is skipped (the reason goes to the Output channel) and the rest are still generated. |
| **FileMaker: Generate TypeScript Client** | first asks you to tick the layouts to include (a multi-select list), then for a folder, then writes `types.ts`, `client.ts` and `README.md` there |
| **FileMaker: Generate Snippets for Layout** | adds two editor snippets to `snippets/filemaker-data-api.code-snippets` in the workspace root. Their descriptions show field result types and kinds when metadata is available. They call this extension's commands (`filemakerDataApiTools.runFindJson` and `filemakerDataApiTools.getRecordById`) from VS Code extension code; they are not Data API client snippets. |

The output folder is `filemaker.typegen.outputDir` (default `filemaker-types`, inside the workspace). **FileMaker: Open Generated Types Folder** opens it.

**Field types.** Generated files use the field's result type. Numbers become TypeScript `number`. JavaScript can lose precision for whole numbers beyond 2^53 - 1 (9,007,199,254,740,991) and for long decimals; a note in the generated file warns about this. If an identifier or amount must stay exact, ask your FileMaker administrator about storing it as text. Dates, times and timestamps stay as strings in the format used by the FileMaker file's locale, so do not assume they are ISO dates. Container values are URL strings. A repeating field uses optional keys such as `Name(1)`, `Name(2)` and so on, through its maximum repetition. The Layout Inspector and schema comparison show the result type separately from the field kind (normal, calculation, summary or global).

**Empty finds and errors.** A generated client's find returns an empty list for FileMaker code 401, including when the server reports HTTP 200, 404 or 500. This also happens if the starting record is past the last match. In the Query Builder the total match count stays visible when FileMaker supplies it, even on an empty page; choose an earlier starting record to see the matches. Other generated-client failures include the FileMaker `code`, HTTP `status` and full `messages` list on the error. A web page instead of a Data API reply gives a message to check the server address and proxy. Regenerate older clients to get these fixes. Names such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, `toString` and `hasOwnProperty` are kept exactly, just like other layout and field names. For request fields with these names, follow the generated README example, which starts with `Object.create(null)` so JavaScript does not confuse them with its built-in object properties.

**File names.** A layout name made only of letters, digits, `_`, `.` and `-` is used as it is (`Contacts.ts`). If the name has any other character (a space, `/`, `:`, accents), the unusable characters become `_` and a short hash of the original name is added, for example `My_Layout-1a2b3c4d.ts`. Two layouts whose names differ only in punctuation therefore get separate files. Reserved Windows names such as `CON` get a safe name. Names that differ only in letter case can still collide on a case-insensitive file system. If you generated files with an older version, delete the old files for layouts whose names have spaces or punctuation.

Database names are escaped when they are written into comments, strings and snippets, so a layout name cannot put code in a generated file.

Regenerate after a schema change, and use a [schema diff](#schema-snapshots-and-diffs) to see which fields moved.

## FM Web and Layout Mode

FM Web is an experimental workflow for designing web layouts that sit on top of your FileMaker data and generating a small Next.js app from them. Everything is under `.fmweb/` in the workspace and needs a trusted workspace.

![Layout Mode with six fields placed on a layout](./marketplace/layout-mode.png)

1. **FileMaker: Initialize FM Web Project** creates `.fmweb/`.
2. **FileMaker: Select Active Profile** and **FileMaker: Sync FM Web Project Metadata** copy layout, field and script metadata into `.fmweb/metadata`.
3. **FileMaker: Open FM Web Layout Mode** opens the designer. Layouts are saved in `.fmweb/layouts`.
4. **FileMaker: Generate FM Web Next.js App** and **FileMaker: Generate FM Web Layout Page** write the app to `.fmweb/generated`.
5. **FileMaker: Start FM Web Preview Server** starts a local bridge (bound to `127.0.0.1`) and runs the app. **The preview needs the source repository.** The Marketplace extension does not include the preview app template, so in a Marketplace installation **Generate FM Web Next.js App** and **Start FM Web Preview Server** are hidden from the Command Palette (the commands that need the template are only listed when it is installed); invoking one another way, for example from a keybinding, still stops with "The FM Web preview is not available in this installation". Layout Mode and metadata sync work everywhere. To use the preview, work from a clone of the repository (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/blob/main/extension/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

New field chips (click to add, or drag onto the canvas) use an 8 px grid, labels on top and standard sizes. Existing layouts load as saved; moving and resizing existing objects still works as before. The page margin is 24 px, rows have at least 16 px between them (plus room for the top label), and columns have a 24 px gap.

| Field type or display | Width × height (px) |
| --- | --- |
| Text, or unknown type | 240 × 34 |
| Long or multiline text | 240 × 96 |
| Number | 120 × 34 |
| Date, time, timestamp | 160 × 34 |
| Checkbox or radio | 240 wide; 24 per option, at least 34 high (sizing capped at 50 options) |
| Container | 240 × 160 |

Layout Mode has three new actions:

- **Arrange standard form** uses **One column** or **Two columns**, in the source FileMaker layout's field order (down the left column, then down the right). With a selection it arranges only selected fields and portals; with no selection it arranges all fields and portals. Portals go underneath at full page width. A narrow canvas uses one column. A selection starts at its snapped top-left; if it conflicts with unselected objects, the selected block moves below them. The canvas grows to fit the resulting form. Text, buttons and other objects stay where they are; portal columns, settings and behaviors stay intact.
- **Standardize selected / Standardize all** applies standard field sizes, top labels and the 8 px grid without rearranging rows. Fields move left/up first to keep the control and top label within the canvas; only a canvas smaller than the standard field grows. Selection limits the action to those fields; no selection applies it to all fields. Field names, labels, bindings, behaviors and stacking order stay intact. Each arrangement or standardization is one Undo step.
- **Apply starter template** appears for a new, empty web layout. **Blank** is the default. Choose a synced **Template FileMaker layout** and **Form**, **Two-column form**, or **Form + first portal**, then apply. The portal template uses the first portal listed in metadata; if there is none, it creates just the form. Templates use every field in the chosen layout, retain names exactly (including spaces), and can be undone in one step, including the field palette and source choice. Layout names are sent initially; full template descriptors load only for the current source and on demand for other choices. Layouts without a FileMaker source retain their cross-layout field palette: its deduplicated type descriptors are capped at 256 KiB (UTF-8 JSON), with text sizing for omitted descriptors. This preserves access to their fields without sending every layout’s full template metadata. Sync metadata first to supply types and field order; unavailable types use text sizing.

FM Web checks its output folders before creating files. Your workspace folder may itself be a symbolic link, but a link below it, including `.fmweb`, `generated` or `runtime-next`, is refused. Choose a real folder there and try again.

When you run **Generate FM Web Next.js App** or **Start FM Web Preview Server** again, the extension refreshes the few managed runtime files (marked `fmweb-managed: runtime template v3`) in an app you generated earlier. It never overwrites a file you edited and never follows a symbolic link: such files are left as they are, and a warning names each one ("These generated preview files were edited (or are symbolic links), so they were not updated: ..."). Delete the named files and run the command again to get fresh copies; until then the preview cannot reach the bridge.

New fields added from the picker or toolbox continue below existing objects on the standard grid, including room for labels. The page grows as needed. Opening **Edit Record by ID** loads the supplied record automatically.

Query Builder find values, Record Editor and Record Viewer use these same widths, top labels and 16 px / 24 px gaps. Narrow panels stack fields into one column. Metadata unavailable means text sizing. These rules affect presentation only; find expressions, editing, copying and validation work as before. Generated web layout pages use the same renderer as Layout Mode: saved field sizes and label positions are retained on wide screens, and objects stack in saved order at 640 px or narrower.

Confirmations you will see:

- **Start FM Web Preview Server** shows the folder and asks before it runs `npm install` and `npm run dev` there. The folder's `package.json` can come from a repository, and npm runs the scripts it defines. Only continue if you trust it.
- **A layout button that runs a script** (a `runScript` behavior) asks before it runs, naming the script, the parameter and the connection, and saying when the project file chose that connection. It also needs the script runner enabled, offline mode off and a policy that allows scripts.

The bridge accepts requests only from your own computer, it needs a trusted workspace, every request must carry a session token, and it serves only the active connection. The token is written to a private `.env.local` in the generated app and sent by the generated client; apps you generated earlier get their managed runtime files refreshed to the current template, and an app whose files you edited is left alone with a warning. Record changes and script runs follow your own limits:

- Record changes (edit, create, delete) are refused in offline mode, when `filemaker.features.recordEdit.enabled` is off, and when the enterprise role or `disabledFeatures` disallow `writeOperations` or `recordEdit`.
- Script runs are refused in offline mode, when `filemaker.features.scriptRunner.enabled` is off, and when the enterprise role or `disabledFeatures` disallow `scriptRunner`.

For the layout file format, architecture and bridge security details, see [FM_WEB.md](./FM_WEB.md).

## Offline mode

Offline mode keeps you working with what the extension has already learned about your schema, and blocks changes.

1. Run **FileMaker: Toggle Offline Mode**. The sidebar shows an **OFFLINE MODE** badge.
2. Layout and field metadata is served from a cache in `.vscode/filemaker/offline-metadata/`. The extension fills the cache whenever it reads layout metadata while online. **FileMaker: Refresh Offline Metadata Cache** caches every layout of a profile in one go. A layout you never opened shows "no cached metadata".
3. Writes are disabled: record edit, create, delete and upload, batch update, the Script Runner, and adding, editing or removing profiles.
4. A warning appears when the cache is older than `filemaker.offline.staleCacheWarnHours` (default 24).

Offline mode does not block finds or opening records: those still call the server, and fail if it is unreachable.

**Turning it off.** Run **FileMaker: Toggle Offline Mode** again. The command changes your **user** setting and tells you the mode that is really in effect. If a workspace setting (for example `offline.mode: true` written into `.vscode/settings.json` by an older version of this extension) keeps offline mode on, the message says so ("still on because of ...") and the command cannot clear it: edit the workspace setting yourself. A workspace can turn offline mode on but never off. Offline mode set in your user settings applies to every workspace you open.

---

## Enterprise mode and roles

Enterprise mode adds role-based limits for shared or regulated environments. It is off by default.

Set `filemaker.enterprise.mode` to `true` and `filemaker.enterprise.role` to one of:

| Role | What it can do |
| --- | --- |
| `viewer` | Read only. Blocked: record edit, create, delete, upload, batch update, the Script Runner, profile add/edit/remove, environment set creation, export of comparison reports, plugins. |
| `developer` (default) | Everything except exporting environment comparison reports and loading plugins. |
| `admin` | Everything. |

A team can also put `.vscode/filemaker.config.json` in a repository:

```json
{
  "enterpriseMode": true,
  "role": "viewer",
  "lockedProfiles": ["<profile id>"],
  "disabledFeatures": ["batchUpdate", "scriptRunner"],
  "enforcedPerformanceMode": "standard",
  "defaultEnvironmentSets": [{ "name": "All", "profiles": ["<profile id>"] }]
}
```

The feature names for `disabledFeatures` are `recordEdit`, `batchUpdate`, `environmentExport`, `pluginInstall`, `scriptRunner`, `writeOperations` and `ai`.

**Restrict-only.** A repository can make the policy stricter but never looser. A workspace setting or this file can turn enterprise mode on and lower the role, but it cannot turn enterprise mode off or raise the role above the one in your own user settings (the default is `developer`). If you used a repository file to grant `admin`, set it in your user settings instead. In the same way, a workspace can switch offline mode on or a `filemaker.features.*.enabled` switch off, but not the reverse.

**Environment Sets** group profiles (for example Dev, Staging, Production) so you can compare them. With enterprise mode on, use **FileMaker: Create Environment Set**, **FileMaker: Compare Environments**, **FileMaker: Diff Layout Across Environments**, **FileMaker: Export Environment Comparison Report** and **FileMaker: Open Environment Set JSON**.

---

## Plugins

Plugins are JavaScript modules that add commands and tree views. The extension looks for them in `.vscode/filemaker-plugins/` in a trusted workspace.

A plugin runs with the same access as the extension: your saved connections and sessions. So the extension asks first:

1. When it finds plugins, a dialog names the files and the workspace. Choose to run them only if you trust the repository.
2. The extension hashes **every file** in the folder. Your approval is remembered for that workspace and that exact content. If any file is added, changed or removed, you are asked again.
3. A folder with more than 500 files, more than 20 MB in total, or a symbolic link, is refused with a message saying why.

Plugins are not loaded in an untrusted workspace, and in enterprise mode only for roles that allow `pluginInstall` (`admin`). Anything a plugin loads from outside its folder is not checked. **FileMaker: List Active Plugins** and **FileMaker: Reload Plugins** are in the Command Palette when `filemaker.advanced.powerUserMode` is on.

## Using AI with FileMaker

AI features are **off by default**. Nothing is read by an AI tool until you turn it on in your own user settings and choose a connection.

> **Read this first.** Anything an AI tool reads is sent to the AI model provider you use, and it can leave through any shell, web or git tool the same agent has. Field values and names are text from your database; a hostile value or name can try to steer an agent. The controls below reduce this. They do not remove it. Connect with a dedicated FileMaker account that has a read-only privilege set: it is the only control that does not depend on the model or on you.

There are four parts, and you can use them separately:

| Part | What it does | Where the data goes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Write AI Context** | Writes a Markdown file of layout, field and script names for AI coding tools to load | Only to the file you choose; no record data |
| **AI tools in VS Code** | Lets agent mode in VS Code (for example Copilot) read records and, if allowed, change them | To the model provider VS Code uses |
| **@filemaker chat** | Read-only commands in the Chat view: layouts, fields, finds, error codes | Names go to the model for plain-language finds; record values stay on screen |
| **External MCP server** | Lets Claude Code, Cursor and other MCP clients use the same tools | To the provider behind that client |

### Minimum to try it

Read-only, about five minutes:

1. Connect to a server as in [First run in 10 minutes](#first-run-in-10-minutes). Use an account whose privilege set is read-only.
2. Open your **user** settings (see [Opening your user settings](#opening-your-user-settings)) and add `"filemaker.ai.enabled": true`.
3. Run **FileMaker: Set AI Access for Connection**, pick the connection, choose **Read**, and answer **Use for AI Tools**.
4. Open an AI agent in VS Code that supports tools (for example Copilot in agent mode) and ask it to list the layouts of your FileMaker database. The first time it reads a layout, VS Code shows a prompt from this extension; approve it.
5. To stop at any time, select the `AI:` item in the status bar.

Nothing else is needed. Writes and scripts stay unavailable until you switch them on (see Rules and limits below). The rest of this chapter explains what each part does and what protects you.

### Write AI Context

AI models guess layout and field names and get find requests wrong. This command gives them the real names.

1. Run **FileMaker: Write AI Context**.
2. Choose a connection if asked, then tick the layouts to describe. None are selected by default and the limit is 50.
3. The extension reads their fields and the script names and writes a Markdown file of at most 20 KB.

What is in it: the connection name, database name, and the names of the layouts, fields and scripts you picked. What is not: record data, value-list values, field descriptions, the server address, the user name or any credential.

Where it goes: by default, the extension's storage folder (outside any repository). You are offered **Open File**, and **Copy into Workspace** (to `.filemaker/ai-context.md`). If the file lands inside the workspace, you are asked whether to add it to `.gitignore`, because it holds database structure.

To write into a file of your own, such as `AGENTS.md`, set `filemaker.ai.contextPath` in your **user** settings to a path relative to the workspace folder (or any file inside the workspace). If the file already exists without the markers, the command asks and, if you choose **Add to the file**, appends a new section at the end and leaves the rest alone. To control where the section goes, add the two marker lines `<!-- filemaker-ai-context:start -->` and `<!-- filemaker-ai-context:end -->` where the section should go. The command replaces only the text between them and refuses to touch anything else. Symbolic links, `.git` and paths outside the workspace are refused, and a workspace cannot set this path.

Names are cleaned: letters, digits, space and `_ - . : ( )`, up to 64 characters. Anything else becomes a placeholder and is counted in the file header. The file says its content is data. A name made only of allowed characters can still read like an instruction to a model, so treat the file as data and keep it out of public repositories.

### AI tools in VS Code (agent mode)

To let an agent use a connection:

1. In your **user** settings, turn on `filemaker.ai.enabled`. A workspace setting cannot turn it on.
2. Run **FileMaker: Set AI Access for Connection**, pick the connection, and choose **Read** (or **Write**, see below). A message then reminds you to use a restricted account and offers **Use for AI Tools**, which sets `filemaker.ai.connection`. A profile's AI access is reset to none when you change its server, user, database or API paths, so you set it again after such an edit. A repository file cannot choose the connection.
3. Open the agent in VS Code. The tools appear in its tool list.

The status bar shows the state: `AI: off`, `AI: off (connection not enabled)`, `AI: read-only`, `AI: writes on` or `AI: scripts on`. The hover text shows records read, write attempts used and the FileMaker account in use.

### Rules and limits

These are the controls the extension applies. They are the reasons it is safe to try; read them before you allow writes or scripts.

- **Read-only.** The tools that read are `fm_list_layouts`, `fm_describe_layout`, `fm_list_scripts`, `fm_find_records`, `fm_get_record` and `fm_explain_error`. Write tools are not offered at all until you switch them on.
- **Writes are opt-in.** `filemaker.ai.allowWrites` adds `fm_edit_record`, `fm_create_record` and `fm_delete_record` (one record per call), and the connection must be set to **Write**. `filemaker.ai.allowScripts` adds `fm_run_script`, which also needs the connection's access to be **Write** and is limited to the scripts you list in `filemaker.ai.scriptAllowlist`, for example `{"<profile id>": ["Export Report"]}`. These settings are read from your user settings only.
- **Read-only fields cannot be written by AI tools.** Calculation, summary and container fields are refused before the write approval dialog, using the layout field list. FileMaker still checks your account’s permissions.
- **Every write is confirmed by you.** Each change opens a dialog built by the extension from a fresh read of the record. VS Code cannot set it to "always allow". It shows the connection, layout, record, every field with the old and new value, and the AI's own description, labelled as the AI's. Deleting asks you to type the record ID. A record changed in the meantime is not overwritten. A write is limited to 10 fields and 200 characters per value, and the whole dialog text to 4,000 characters (escaped characters take extra room), so that the dialog can show all of it; a larger write is refused.
- **You approve each layout.** The first read of a layout in a session asks you (at most 20 layouts a session). List layouts you trust in `filemaker.ai.readableLayouts` to skip the question.
- **Limits.** 50 records per call, 500 records per session, 30 calls a minute, 10 write attempts per session and 3 a minute (a declined attempt counts). Results are capped at 200 KB.
- **Hidden fields.** `filemaker.ai.hiddenFields` lists field names AI tools never see (case-insensitive, with or without `Table::`). **Write AI Context** honours it too: hidden fields are left out of the context file, and the file and the confirmation say how many were left out. This is by name only. It does not stop disclosure through a calculation, a summary field or a script result.
- **Offline mode** blocks AI reads as well as writes. AI tools are not registered in an untrusted workspace.
- **Portal results:** AI record reads include at most 20 rows per portal. If rows were left out by this limit or by the server, the answer reports `truncated: true`. Returned and total counts are included when FileMaker supplies the total; there is no automatic portal paging.
- **Left out of results:** container fields and URLs, and the server address. Text that looks like a secret is redacted, which can rewrite a field value that looks like one; writes refuse values that contain the redaction marker.

### Chat with @filemaker

`@filemaker` is a participant in VS Code's Chat view. It reads the database through the same AI tools and the same rules as agent mode, and it is **read only**: it has no command that edits, creates, deletes or runs a script, even if you switched writes and scripts on for agent mode. It needs the same setup: `filemaker.ai.enabled` in your user settings and a connection set with **FileMaker: Set AI Access for Connection**.

![@filemaker answering a find in the Chat view (made with a stand-in language model)](./marketplace/chat-participant.png)

Type `@filemaker` in the Chat view, then:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/layouts` | Lists the layouts of the connection chosen for AI. |
| `/describe LAYOUT` | Shows the fields and their types. Hidden fields are left out. Value lists are not available through AI tools, so they are not shown. |
| `/find LAYOUT criteria` | Finds records. `Name==Ada; City=Paris` (field names exactly as `/describe` shows them, separated by `;`) is sent as written. Any other text, such as `/find Customers people in Paris named Ada`, is turned into a search by the language model you picked in the chat; the extension checks the search exactly as it checks a tool call, and shows it before it runs. A `Field=value` search returns up to 10 records; at most 20 records are ever shown. |
| `/explain CODE` | Explains a FileMaker error code. With no code it uses the last FileMaker error `@filemaker` saw. |
| `/help` | Lists the commands. |

Which settings matter: `filemaker.ai.enabled`, the connection chosen with **Set AI Access for Connection** (`filemaker.ai.connection`), `filemaker.ai.hiddenFields` and `filemaker.ai.readableLayouts`. `filemaker.ai.allowWrites`, `filemaker.ai.allowScripts` and the script allowlist do not matter here: the participant never offers a write or a script.

What you will see:

- In an **untrusted workspace** (Restricted Mode) the AI tools are not registered, but `@filemaker` is still listed. It answers every request with "AI tools are not available right now" and the reason ("AI tools are unavailable in an untrusted workspace"), and reads nothing. Trust the workspace to use it. Offline mode and an enterprise policy that switches AI off give the same kind of answer, naming the reason.
- A request longer than 1,000 characters is refused.
- The first time `@filemaker` reads a layout in a session, the extension asks you, as for any AI tool. The limits (50 records a call, 500 a session, 30 calls a minute) and the kill switch apply, and a `/find` is three tool calls.
- Layout names, field names and record values are shown as plain text in boxes. Nothing from the database is shown as a link, image or button.
- If AI tools are off, `@filemaker` says so and gives a button that opens the AI settings. The status bar kill switch, an untrusted workspace, offline mode and enterprise policy turn it off too, and it tells you which.
- Calls from chat appear in **Show AI Activity** with the client `chat participant`.

What is sent to the model: only for plain-language `/find`, the model you chose in the chat gets the layout name, that layout's field names (hidden fields removed) and the words you typed. It does not get record values, connection names, the server address or credentials, and it can only ask for one read-only search. Record values are shown in the chat and stay in the chat history of VS Code, which later chat messages (yours or another participant's) can send to a model. Field names are text from your database, so a hostile field name can still reach the model; use a read-only FileMaker account.

### Kill switch, sessions and activity

Three commands exist for this. They appear in the Command Palette only while AI tools are active (switched on and offered); the status bar item always works.

- **FileMaker: Switch AI Tools Off or On**, or select the `AI:` status bar item, switches every AI tool off at once. Select the status bar item again to switch back on; you are asked first. Switching off and on does not reset any limit. While tools are switched off the command is hidden from the palette, so use the status bar item to turn them back on.
- **FileMaker: Start New AI Session** resets the record quota, the write counters and all layout approvals, after asking you.
- **FileMaker: Show AI Activity** opens a log of what was called: tool, connection, layout, record IDs, outcome and whether you confirmed. It does not record field values, is kept outside the workspace, and is capped at 256 KB.

**Keep policy in your user settings.** A workspace file can be edited by an agent that has file-editing tools. Put `filemaker.ai.hiddenFields` and the enterprise switches (`filemaker.features.ai.enabled`, an `ai` entry in `disabledFeatures`) in your user settings, or in an enterprise-managed location, not only in `.vscode/settings.json`. A workspace or enterprise file can switch AI off through `filemaker.features.ai.enabled` or `disabledFeatures`, and cannot switch it on.

### Claude Code, Cursor and other MCP clients

The same tools, with the same limits, approvals and dialogs, are available to MCP clients that run outside VS Code. This is off by default and works only in local VS Code windows, not in Dev Containers, Codespaces, SSH or WSL windows (the server will not start there).

1. Set up AI access as above (turn on `filemaker.ai.enabled`, set a connection).
2. In the window you want to use, run **FileMaker: Start/Stop AI Server for External Tools**. The command always asks in a dialog first; the dialog says the server will start automatically each time you open this workspace. If `filemaker.ai.externalServer.enabled` is off, the same dialog turns it on in your user settings. Nothing can start the server, or make it start automatically, without that dialog. The status bar item then reads `AI: ... · MCP`, and its tooltip shows the number of connections. Running the command again to stop the server asks nothing.
3. Run **FileMaker: Copy MCP Config for Claude Code / Cursor** and paste the result into Claude Code's `.mcp.json` (or use `claude mcp add-json filemaker '<the filemaker entry>'`) or into Cursor's `mcp.json`. The config points at a copy of the client program (`aiMcpShim.js`) kept in the extension's storage, in a folder only you can use, so it keeps working after extension updates. If the copy could not be made, the message says so and you copy the config again after an update.
4. The client starts that small program with `node`, and it connects to your VS Code window. **Node.js 18 or newer must be on the PATH of the client**; without it the config cannot run.

**The setting is a permission, not a switch.** `filemaker.ai.externalServer.enabled` (user settings only) only allows the server; it never starts it. A window runs the server only after you ran **Start/Stop AI Server for External Tools** in that window and confirmed. VS Code remembers that for that workspace and starts the server again each time you open it, while the setting is on, until you run the same command there to stop it. Stopping persists, also after a restart. Turning the setting off stops the server in every window where it runs and ends the automatic start for every workspace, including closed ones; turning the setting on again does not bring them back, and you start the server there again by running the command. A window you never started it in never runs it.

How it is protected: a socket in a folder only you can use (on Windows an unguessable named pipe), the folder name includes a hash of the product's storage path so VS Code, Insiders and Cursor do not share one; a secret per-session token in a file only you can read; the program checks that the window that wrote the file is still the same process before it sends the token. With several windows running the server, the config names the folder and the program refuses to guess. You get a notification when a program connects (at most one every 30 seconds), and the connection count is in the status bar tooltip. The name an MCP client gives itself appears only in **Show AI Activity**, never in a dialog. Layout approvals and write dialogs still appear in VS Code, and if the client cancels or disconnects while a dialog is open, nothing is sent whatever you answer. Everything the tools return is sent to the provider behind your MCP client, which is often a different provider from the one VS Code uses.

## User settings vs Workspace settings in plain words

VS Code has two places to set most options. **User settings** are yours and follow you to every project. **Workspace settings** live in the project (`.vscode/settings.json`) and apply only there, to everyone who opens it. A project can therefore ship settings you did not choose, so this extension does not let a project loosen anything that protects you. That is why a value you type in the **Workspace** tab can seem to do nothing. There are three kinds of setting:

| Kind | What the Workspace tab does | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User settings only** | Nothing. A workspace value is ignored (VS Code may not even show the setting in the Workspace tab). | all `filemaker.ai.*` settings except `hiddenFields`, `filemaker.secrets.fallback`, `filemaker.export.neutralizeFormulas` |
| **Workspace can only make this stricter** | A value that adds a restriction counts; one that would loosen your user value is ignored. | `filemaker.offline.mode` (can only turn on), `filemaker.features.*.enabled` (can only turn off), `filemaker.enterprise.mode` (can only turn on), `filemaker.enterprise.role` (can only lower), `filemaker.ai.hiddenFields` (can only add names) |
| **Per workspace** | Works as you expect. Some are ignored until you trust the folder. | `filemaker.savedQueries.scope`, `filemaker.typegen.outputDir`, `filemaker.schema.snapshots.storage`, `filemaker.batch.*`, timeouts, and the rest |

Every setting's description in the Settings editor starts with one of these three labels.

**See what is really in effect.** Run **FileMaker: Show Effective Settings**. For every policy-related setting it shows the value in effect, where it comes from (Default, User, Workspace, Workspace Folder, Enterprise file or Restricted Mode), your User and Workspace values and, when a workspace value is ignored, a plain sentence saying why, with buttons to open the User or Workspace tab at that setting. The value in effect is read by the same code that applies the rule (and for the on/off switches the explanation is built from the same reading); the page is a snapshot that refreshes when settings change. When a configured value is not usable as written it adds a note: for example a User role that is not viewer, developer or admin is treated as developer, and a `filemaker.typegen.outputDir` that is empty, absolute or contains `..` falls back to the default folder. When a project ships a value that is ignored, the extension also tells you once per setting for that workspace, with **Don't show again for this workspace**.

Limits worth knowing. In **Restricted Mode** VS Code hides workspace values of the restricted settings, so the page says they are ignored until you trust the folder, and the extension does not read the workspace settings files at all. In a trusted workspace it reads `.vscode/settings.json` and the `.code-workspace` file only to catch User-only settings (VS Code hides those); a file that is large, a link or not valid JSON is reported instead of being used. In a multi-root workspace a folder's `.vscode/settings.json` applies only to files in that folder, not to these window-wide settings.

**Saved query scope.** `filemaker.savedQueries.scope` stores `workspace` or `global`. `workspace` keeps queries for this workspace on this computer (VS Code stores them; they are not in your project files, and other workspaces do not see them); `global` makes them available in every workspace on this computer (on each machine separately in a remote window). Changing it does not move queries you already saved.

---

## Settings reference

Open Settings (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`) and search for `filemaker`; make sure the **User** tab is selected for the user-only settings (or see [Opening your user settings](#opening-your-user-settings)). Not sure which value wins? Run **FileMaker: Show Effective Settings**. In the table, **Badge** is the same label that starts each setting's description in the Settings editor (see [User settings vs Workspace settings](#user-settings-vs-workspace-settings-in-plain-words)):

- **User or workspace**: either; a workspace value applies only to that workspace.
- **User only**: read from your user settings only. A workspace or dev container value is ignored.
- **ignored in an untrusted workspace**: in Restricted Mode the setting's workspace value is not used.
- **Workspace can only make it stricter**: a workspace may turn offline mode on, a feature off, enterprise mode on, or the role lower, and never the reverse. A workspace value that would loosen your user value is ignored. Details: [User settings vs Workspace settings in plain words](#user-settings-vs-workspace-settings-in-plain-words).
- **(T)**: VS Code ignores the workspace value in an untrusted workspace (Restricted Mode).

**Connection**

| Setting | Default | Badge | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `filemaker.requestTimeoutMs` | `15000` | Per workspace | Timeout for each Data API request, in milliseconds. |
| `filemaker.defaultApiBasePath` | `"/fmi/data"` | Per workspace | API path used when a profile does not set one. |
| `filemaker.defaultApiVersionPath` | `"vLatest"` | Per workspace | Data API version segment used when a profile does not set one. |

Old names: `filemakerDataApiTools.logLevel`, `.requestTimeoutMs`, `.defaultApiBasePath` and `.defaultApiVersionPath` still work but are replaced by `filemaker.logging.level`, `filemaker.requestTimeoutMs`, `filemaker.defaultApiBasePath` and `filemaker.defaultApiVersionPath`. A more specific value wins whichever name it uses. The extension offers a one-click migration.

## Security behavior you will notice

Error messages hide plain-text `api_key` values and `X-FM-Data-Access-Token` headers.

- **Workspace trust.** In an untrusted workspace (Restricted Mode, see [above](#trusted-workspace-and-restricted-mode)) you can browse, read metadata and run finds. Editing, creating and deleting records, uploading to containers, the Script Runner, batch export and update, writing files (type generation, snippets, snapshots on disk, the AI context copy, FM Web), plugins, the FM Web preview and AI tools need a trusted workspace. Trust is checked each time, and an open panel refuses changes if trust is lost. This is not a free pass in a trusted workspace: the prompts below still apply.
- **Virtual workspaces** (such as github.dev) are not supported: the extension writes files to a folder on disk.
- **Prompts before risky actions.** You are asked before: saving a record (lists the changed fields), deleting a record, running a batch update, running workspace plugins, starting the FM Web preview (`npm install`, `npm run dev`), running a script from a Layout Mode button, switching AI tools back on, every AI write, and sending credentials to a template-supplied address or a remote `http://` address.
- **Secrets stay in the keychain.** Passwords, API keys and session tokens are kept in VS Code SecretStorage and never shown in webviews.
- **Redaction.** Logs, request history, error details and copied snippets hide authorization headers, session tokens (including in request paths), token-like query parameters and JSON keys (anything containing `token`, `secret`, `password`, `session` or `apiKey`), and passwords inside URLs. Copied requests (curl, fetch(), .http, Postman, TypeScript) never contain a password, session token or API key: the Authorization header shows `<REDACTED>`, or with the opt-in a variable name, and the server address loses any account or query string typed into it.
- **Certificates.** The server certificate is checked, except for a profile that still has the older allow-self-signed setting (that skips every check, and shows a warning). You can trust one specific certificate by its fingerprint (never from a workspace file); a different certificate later is a hard failure, and for a normal or pinned profile nothing is sent before the certificate is checked. A pin is trust on first use: it does not authenticate who presented the certificate when you trusted it (see [What pinning does and does not give you](#what-pinning-does-and-does-not-give-you)).
- **Repositories cannot loosen your policy.** Workspace settings and `.vscode/filemaker.config.json` can only restrict enterprise mode, roles, offline mode and feature switches.
- **No telemetry.** The extension sends nothing to its authors. It talks only to your FileMaker server (or your proxy).
- **Local files that hold schema.** Snapshots, the offline cache, generated types and the AI context file contain layout and field names. Do not commit them to a public repository.

For the full picture, see [docs/security.md](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/blob/main/docs/security.md) and [docs/DATA_HANDLING.md](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/blob/main/docs/DATA_HANDLING.md).

## Troubleshooting

Connection errors name the step that failed and what to do. The most common first-run failure is a **certificate error** (the first rows of the first table). A fuller catalogue of what can go wrong between VS Code and FileMaker, with what to ask your administrator, is in the [FileMaker failure-mode catalogue](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/blob/main/docs/FILEMAKER_FAILURE_MODES.md) (section 8 is "Troubleshooting by symptom").

### Where to look first

- **The message itself.** Read it to the end: it says what happened and what to change. Notifications offer **Retry** only where trying again can help (not for certificates, privilege problems or FileMaker's own errors), **Edit Profile** only for rejected credentials or a wrong database name, **Trust this certificate…** or **Review and re-trust** for a certificate you may decide on, **Open Settings** for timeouts, and **Details…**. The details document shows the failing endpoint and the retry chain, redacted, and is safe to paste into a bug report.
- **Test Connection** (in the connection wizard) tells you which step failed: reaching the Data API, listing the databases, or signing in. See [Test Connection, step by step](#test-connection-step-by-step).
- **Status bar:** the `FileMaker: <profile>` item says `sign-in failed`, `certificate problem` or `unreachable` after a failed request; its tooltip repeats the reason.
- **Output panel:** View > Output, then choose **FileMaker Data API Tools** in the dropdown. Set `filemaker.logging.level` to `debug` for more detail. Secrets are redacted.
- **FileMaker: Show Diagnostics** opens a report with your VS Code and extension versions, operating system, active profile (no secrets), settings and recent log lines. Attach it to bug reports. **FileMaker: Show Effective Settings** shows the value in effect for the policy-related settings (24 of them: the switches, limits and paths a project could try to change), not every setting.

### Connecting: certificates and network

| What you see | What it means and what to do |
| --- | --- |
| "This server uses a certificate that is not trusted: FileMaker Server's default certificate is self-signed" | The server still has FileMaker's built-in certificate. In the wizard the **Trust this certificate** dialog appears by itself; see [First connection to a server with FileMaker's default certificate](#first-connection-to-a-server-with-filemakers-default-certificate). A CA file alone will not fix this one (the certificate has no host names). For production install a certificate from a public authority. |
| "This server's certificate is not trusted by this computer. The certificate chain could not be verified ..." (`unable to verify the first certificate`) | The authority is not trusted here, or the server does not send its intermediate certificate (a common cause). Ask the administrator to install the full certificate chain, or, if the certificate lists the server's host names and your company's authority issued it, set that authority's CA file under **Certificates (advanced)**, or trust this one certificate (the message mentions the CA file only in that case). See [Certificates](#certificates). |
| "The certificate of <host> is self-signed, and this computer does not trust it" | Use **Trust this certificate…** after checking the fingerprint, or ask for a certificate from a public authority. |
| "The certificate of <host> lists no host names" | The certificate has no names, so it can never match. Trust that one certificate (the button is offered), or ask for one issued for the server's name. |
| "The certificate of <host> was not issued for that name" | You connected with a name or IP address the certificate does not list. Use a name from the certificate, or ask the administrator which name it was issued for. |
| "The security certificate of <host> has expired" / "is not valid yet" | First check your computer's date and time. If the clock is right, the server's certificate needs renewing (Admin Console > Configuration > SSL Certificate). |
| "The certificate of <host> has been revoked" | Ask your administrator to install a new certificate. |
| "... is not the one you trusted for this connection" (button **Review and re-trust**) | The server presented a different certificate than the one pinned. If your administrator renewed it, review the new fingerprint and re-trust; otherwise do not continue. |
| "The certificate you trusted for <host> has expired" | Ask the administrator to renew it, then review and re-trust. |
| "A proxy is configured on this computer (HTTPS_PROXY, VS Code http.proxy, or a system/PAC proxy), and a trusted (pinned) server certificate cannot be checked through a proxy" | A pinned connection is direct only. For a VS Code or system/PAC proxy, exclude the server in that proxy's settings. For an environment proxy, add the server's host name to `NO_PROXY` (then restart VS Code) so the pinned connection goes direct, or remove the proxy setting. For a certificate with proper host names you can instead get one issued and use a CA file, but not for FileMaker's default certificate: forgetting the pin and setting a CA file does nothing for it. A profile that has a pinned certificate ignores its CA file, and the message says so. |
| "This server's certificate failed VS Code's own certificate check (...), and this connection's certificate settings could not be applied ..." | A backup message for an untrusted pin/legacy request left on the environment-proxy route while VS Code's networking patch is active. It never replaces a CA-only error, and the network code and trust actions remain available. Direct pinned and legacy connections apply their certificate settings themselves and do not get this message. If the error persists, try `http.proxySupport` set to `fallback` and test again, or ask your administrator to install a publicly trusted certificate. |
| "The CA file ... does not contain a certificate" / "Unable to read TLS CA bundle at ..." | The CA path is wrong, unreadable, or not a PEM file with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` blocks (a public certificate, not a key). |
| "only offers old TLS versions" / "no TLS version or cipher is shared" | The server or proxy needs TLS 1.2 or newer. Ask the administrator. The extension will not lower its minimum. |
| "<host> does not speak https on that port" | Wrong port, or a plain-http service. Check the Server URL and port. |
| "The connection to <host> was closed. The server may only accept https" | You used `http://` against an HTTPS-only server. Use `https://`. |
| "Nothing is listening on <host:port>" | Wrong port, or FileMaker Server or the Data API is not running. |
| "The name <host> could not be found" / "could not be looked up right now" | Misspelt host name, or the VPN is not connected / DNS is not answering. |
| "Connecting to <host> timed out" / "no network route" | A firewall is dropping the traffic, the server is unreachable, or your VPN is down. Raise `filemaker.requestTimeoutMs` only for a slow (not unreachable) server. |
| "The server closed the connection ... before answering" | The server restarted, or a firewall or proxy dropped the connection. Try again; if it keeps happening, ask the administrator. |
| "The server did not return Data API JSON (...; HTTP n, content type)" | A web page, firewall, proxy or sign-in page answered instead of FileMaker Server, or the reply was empty or cut off. Open the Server URL in a browser; check the base path and version and that the Data API is enabled. |
| "The server redirected the request" | The Data API never redirects. Use the final address as the Server URL (check `http` vs `https`, and any sign-in page in front of the server). Redirects are not followed. |
| HTTP 404 (no FileMaker error code) | Nothing answered at that address: check the Server URL, the API base path and version, the database name, and that the FileMaker Data API is enabled (Admin Console > Connectors). A 404 that carries a FileMaker error code, or HTTP 405 or 501, means the server does not offer that feature (for example metadata); run **FileMaker: Refresh Schema Cache** or check the layout name. |
| HTTP 502, 503, 504 | A gateway could not reach FileMaker Server or it did not answer in time. The server may be restarting or overloaded; try again shortly. The status bar shows `unreachable`. |
| HTTP 429 | The server or gateway asked for a pause. The extension reads `Retry-After`; wait, and avoid large exports at busy times. |
| HTTP 403 | The server or a gateway refused the request: the account may lack the privilege, or a firewall blocked it. Ask the administrator; editing the connection will not help. |

### Signing in

| What you see | What it means and what to do |
| --- | --- |
| "Reached the server, but sign-in failed: ... [212] Invalid user account and/or password" | Wrong account name or password (the account name is not case sensitive; the password is), or the account's privilege set lacks the `fmrest` extended privilege, which can look the same. Edit the connection, type the password again, **Test Connection**. If the message lists the databases the server hosts, compare the database name. |
| "Sign-in is paused: FileMaker rejected the saved credentials (error 210-214 or 1703) ..." | The extension stopped signing in by itself so repeated failures cannot lock the account. Fix the account or password (210 inactive, 211 expired: change it in FileMaker Pro, 212 wrong, 213 the account does not exist, 214 too many attempts: wait first, 1703 the server wants a different sign-in method such as a Claris ID or external authentication), then edit the connection and save, or run **Connect** or **Test Connection**. |
| Error 956 (no free Data API sessions) | The server reached its session limit (Claris words error 956 "Maximum number of database or Admin API sessions exceeded"; the Claris pages document neither a numeric maximum nor a setting for it). The pause message reads "FileMaker has reached its maximum number of database or Admin API sessions. Waiting n s before signing in again". Automatic sign-ins wait 30 seconds, then longer (up to 5 minutes). Ask the administrator to disconnect idle clients: Admin Console > Databases > Clients list > select the client > Disconnect (Data API clients are disconnected immediately). Use **Connect** to try now. |
| Error 1703, or a rejected sign-in on a FileMaker Cloud host | FileMaker Cloud normally uses Claris ID sign-in, which this extension does not support; an account name and password may not be accepted by your Cloud tenant (ask Claris or your administrator). The message on a Cloud host says the same. The same code on another server can mean external authentication. |
| Error 802, or "unable to open file" | The file is closed or not hosted, or the account's privilege set lacks the `fmrest` extended privilege for it. Check the database name; ask the administrator. Connect does not retry this error. |
| "Session expired" or error 952 | The Data API token timed out. The extension renews it and retries once on its own. If it keeps happening, disconnect and connect again. |
| "SecretStorage unavailable (…)" | VS Code could not reach the OS keychain (common on Linux without a keyring, and in some remote windows). Install and unlock a keyring, or set `filemaker.secrets.fallback` (user settings). |
| The wizard asks for the password again | You changed the server address, proxy address or user name. This is intended. |

### Data, privileges and batch jobs

| What you see | What it means and what to do |
| --- | --- |
| A find returns nothing | FileMaker reports "no records match" as error code 401: verified on a real server (FileMaker Data API Engine, 2026-10-21) as HTTP 200 with an empty data list. Older/other versions may use another status; the extension accepts code 401 on any status, and the extension shows an empty result, not an error. If it is unexpected, check the criteria and the account's record access. Do not confuse it with HTTP 401, which is a sign-in or session problem. |
| Error 9, 200, 202, 203, 205, 207, "Insufficient privileges", "Record access is denied" | Your account's privilege set does not allow this. Ask the administrator for the access; editing the connection will not help. |
| "Find criteria are empty" / "Missing required property" (400 / 10) | Enter at least one field value to search, or use Get records to list records. An empty search cannot list records. |
| "This parameter is too long to send" | The encoded URL exceeds 2,000 characters and a text-field find cannot carry it. Shorten it or use a layout with a text field without a record ID. See [Run scripts](#run-scripts). |
| "The script did not run because this layout has no records" | A read confirmed that this layout has no visible records, so the script did not run. Add a record or use a layout that has records. |
| "The server did not confirm that the script ran" | The response had no `scriptError`. Check the script before trying again; the runner cannot confirm execution. |
| "Script runner is not supported on this server/profile." | The server refused both the script endpoint and the attach-to-another-request form (405, 501 or a FileMaker 404). Check the layout and script exist for the account and the server version supports the Data API script calls. |
| Error 105 (layout is missing) or 104 (script is missing) | The name is misspelled, was renamed, or the account cannot see it. |
| Error 306 on save | The record changed since you loaded it. See [edit a record](#edit-a-record). |
| Error 301 (record in use) | Another user or a script has the record open. Try again shortly. |
| Errors 500 to 511 on save | The value failed the field's validation (date, range, unique, value list and so on). |
| A save worked but a script error is shown | The layout ran a script that reported an error. The record was saved; the message names the script phase and the FileMaker error. This is shown for edit, create, delete, find and container upload; getting a single record does not display script errors. |
| Batch update: "stopped" with FileMaker's reason and a number not attempted | The account cannot do updates at all (error 9 insufficient privileges, 205 cannot create records, 207 cannot change the schema) or its credentials were rejected. Records already updated stay updated. |
| Batch update: some records failed with error 200 | A record-level access rule hides those records from your account. They are listed with the reason; the job carried on with the rest. |
| Layouts or fields are missing in the sidebar | Select **Refresh Connections**, then **Refresh Schema Cache**. Your privilege set may show only some layouts. In offline mode only cached layouts show. |
| Commands are greyed out or missing | You may be in an untrusted workspace, in offline mode, or limited by the enterprise role. The message names the reason. Some commands appear only after you add a profile. |
| Proxy returns errors | Test the proxy endpoint outside VS Code. In proxy mode the proxy must keep the Data API request and response shapes. A proxy that returns `fmCode` and `status` in its error reply gets the same messages as a direct connection; one that does not gets the generic proxy message. Redirects are not followed. |
| A generated file has an unexpected name | See [file names](#generate-types-a-client-and-snippets). |
| CSV cells start with an apostrophe | See [apostrophes in CSV files](#batch-export-and-batch-update). |
| `AI: off` in the status bar | AI tools are off by default. See [Using AI with FileMaker](#using-ai-with-filemaker). |
| A setting seems to do nothing | A workspace value may be ignored. Run **FileMaker: Show Effective Settings**, which covers the 24 policy-related settings; for any other setting the Settings editor's badge (**Per workspace**) tells you it works as typed. |

### Which version am I running?

![The About message](./marketplace/about.png)

Run **FileMaker: About / Show Version** from the Command Palette. It shows the extension version, the build (commit and date), your VS Code version, the **Extension host** line (`Node x, Electron y`: use it to check whether your Node is 22.15 or newer, which the operating system certificate store needs), operating system, remote window, workspace trust and language. The same version appears without running anything: in the tooltip of the **FileMaker** status bar item, next to the **FileMaker Explorer** title (for example `v1.4.0`), at the bottom of each panel, and in the first line the extension writes to the Output panel when it starts.

The About message has three buttons: **Copy for bug report** (a short block of exactly those facts, plus whether AI tools and enterprise mode are on; it never holds a server address, profile name, user name, token or folder path), **Open Changelog**, and **Report an Issue** (opens the bug form with the version fields filled in). **Show Diagnostics** includes the same block.

### Reporting a problem

Open an issue at <https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/issues> and include: the extension and VS Code versions (run **About / Show Version** and choose **Copy for bug report**), your operating system, the server type and version, direct or proxy mode, the steps, and the redacted log or the **Show Diagnostics** report. Do not open a public issue for a security problem: see [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## FAQ

**Does the extension send data anywhere besides my server?** No. It has no telemetry. It talks only to your FileMaker server or proxy. AI features send data to an AI provider only if you turn them on, and only what a tool returns.

**Which FileMaker versions work?** Server 21 is the primary target; 19 and 20 are expected to work; FileMaker Cloud is untested (the extension has no Claris ID login; whether a tenant accepts an account name and password is not confirmed). See [Compatibility](./COMPATIBILITY.md).

**Does it support OAuth or single sign-on?** No. Direct mode uses an account name and password. If you need another identity flow, put a proxy in front.

**Where are my profiles and queries stored?** Profiles in VS Code user data (secrets in the keychain). Saved queries in the workspace by default. Snapshots, the offline cache and generated files in the workspace. See [DATA_HANDLING.md](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/blob/main/docs/DATA_HANDLING.md).

**Can I share connections with my team?** Share a [profile template](#profile-templates-for-a-team) (no secrets) and saved queries (export and import). Everyone enters their own password.

**Why can't I turn offline mode off?** A workspace setting (for example `offline.mode: true` in `.vscode/settings.json`) can keep it on, and the toggle cannot clear that. The message names the cause. See [Offline mode](#offline-mode).

**Why is the Command Palette missing some commands?** Many appear only with a profile; enterprise and power-user commands need those modes. See [The FileMaker sidebar](#the-filemaker-sidebar).

**Are there keyboard shortcuts?** None by default. Bind any command in VS Code's Keyboard Shortcuts editor.

**Can the extension edit scripts or layouts in the database?** No. It uses the Data API, which reads and writes records, runs scripts and reads metadata. It does not change the database design.

**Can I try it without a server?** The repository includes a mock Data API for development. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/blob/main/extension/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Where do I get help or report a bug?** [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SureForgeTech/filemaker-data-api-for-vs-code/issues).
